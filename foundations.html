          <strong> üß¨ Ownership Genealogy (Pre-Quan Structures)</strong>
        </summary>
        <p>
          <strong>Function:</strong> Traces the
          <strong>historical and legal heritage</strong> behind the restaurant‚Äôs
          governance model. It looks at how <strong>shared addresses</strong>,
          <strong>early co-ventures</strong>, and
          <strong>family ties</strong> shaped power relations. Explains
          <strong
            >why some actors never appeared on paper, yet shaped real
            decisions</strong
          >.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Fields:</strong> This format borrows from
          <strong>corporate genealogy</strong> (used in ownership tracing),
          <strong>due diligence reports</strong> (in investment law), and
          <strong>archival governance reviews</strong> (in litigation and
          compliance history).
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Usage:</strong> Often applied by
          <strong>litigators</strong> (in multi-entity disputes),
          <strong>employment lawyers</strong> (tracing indirect influence), or
          <strong>forensic analysts</strong> (in founder-linked operations). It
          helps uncover <strong>legacy dynamics</strong> that outlast formal
          transitions.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Adaptation:</strong> This approach explores how
          <strong>personal histories, conflict, and dependence</strong> shaped
          later decisions‚Äîwithout assuming motive or guilt. It maps
          <strong>what got passed on and what didn‚Äôt</strong>, and offers
          <strong>a long view‚Äîbefore Quan was even an idea</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Structure:</strong> The timeline runs from
          <strong>1993 to 2013</strong>. It highlights
          <strong>key events</strong>, <strong>turning points</strong>, and
          <strong>actors</strong> across restaurants and documents. The
          reconstruction uses <strong>first-person cues</strong> to trace
          <strong>who influenced and how things moved forward</strong>.
        </p>
      </details>

      <p>
        The ambiguity in responsibility at the heart of Quan‚Äôs management ‚Äî
        marked by <strong>avoidance</strong>, <strong>blurred roles</strong>,
        and a <strong>lack of steady accountability</strong> ‚Äî struck me the
        most. It naturally led to an archaeology of how this scaffolding was
        laid.
      </p>
      <p>
        What would later become Quan‚Äôs core emerged over a decade earlier at
        <strong>Lilla Torg</strong>, a central square in Malm√∂ known for upscale
        restaurants and nightlife.
      </p>

      <p>
        On <strong>April 16, 1993</strong>, brothers
        <strong>Toni Petersson</strong> and <strong>Ronnie Petersson</strong>,
        both of mixed Japanese‚ÄìSwedish heritage, opened
        <strong>Izakaya Koi</strong> ‚Äî a chic venue blending sushi bar
        aesthetics with lounge and nightclub energy. It quickly became one of
        Malm√∂‚Äôs most popular spots.
      </p>

      <p>
        Just meters away, <strong>Jayantilal Chudasama</strong>, a respected
        figure in Malm√∂‚Äôs Lilla Torg restaurant scene, had formalized the
        <em>Steakhouse Lilla Torg</em> concept in <strong>1991</strong>. His
        son, <strong>Saahil Chudasama</strong>, would later join him, already
        familiar with the square‚Äôs daily rhythm.
      </p>

      <p>
        By <strong>late 2004</strong>, the Petersson brothers had disappeared
        from the official records ‚Äî reportedly relocating to Costa Rica.
        <strong>Henrik Siebert</strong> emerged publicly for the first time as
        the one taking over the venue.
      </p>

      <h3>üìç <span style="font-size: 1.2rem; font-weight: 600">2004</span></h3>
      <p>
        On <strong>November 19</strong>, <strong>Henrik</strong> was officially
        registered as a <em>Board Member</em> of
        <strong>IZAKAYAKOI Aktiebolag</strong> ‚Äî the original corporate entity
        behind Izakaya Koi's first iteration. He remained in this role until the
        company‚Äôs <strong>liquidation in 2011</strong>, marking the end of its
        legal structure.
      </p>
      <h3>üìç <span style="font-size: 1.2rem; font-weight: 600">2006</span></h3>

      <p>
        On the night of <strong>12 October 2006 at 3 a.m.</strong>, during a
        study trip to London, a violent altercation occurred between
        <strong>Henrik Siebert</strong> and kitchen employee
        <strong>Frej S√∂derberg</strong> at a nightclub.
        <strong>Saahil Chudasama</strong>, not officially employed but close to
        the team, intervened physically.
      </p>

      <p>
        Employee <strong>Daniela Dahl</strong>, later registered at the same
        address as Henrik and eventually listed on the company‚Äôs board, was also
        present. The incident led to Frej‚Äôs dismissal shortly after the group
        returned to Malm√∂.
      </p>

      <p>
        On <strong>1 December</strong>, 26 members of the
        <strong>SAC union</strong> staged a public blockade of the restaurant.
        The protest led to a collective trial in
        <strong>September 2007</strong> at Malm√∂ District Court.
      </p>

      <h3>üìç <span style="font-size: 1.2rem; font-weight: 600">2008</span></h3>

      <p>
        On <strong>16 January 2008</strong>, the Swedish Labour Court ruled that
        Frej S√∂derberg was lawfully dismissed for serious misconduct after
        initiating a physical altercation.
      </p>

      <p>
        The court acknowledged legal violations by the employer and awarded:
        <strong>15,000 SEK</strong> for procedural breach (lack of written
        notice and union consult), and <strong>5,000 SEK</strong> for failure to
        issue a written contract.
      </p>
      <p>
        The SAC union was ordered to pay <strong>139,000 SEK</strong> in legal
        fees, to reimburse the opposing party‚Äôs litigation and attorney costs.
      </p>

      <p>
        On <strong>26 November 2008</strong>, <strong>Realtid</strong> reported
        that <strong>Skatteverket</strong> had frozen
        <strong>Izakaya Koi</strong>‚Äôs bank accounts and revoked its alcohol
        license due to massive bookkeeping fraud. Estimated tax debt reached
        <strong>905,780 SEK</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        On <strong>9 December</strong>,
        <strong>Izakayakoi Aktiebolag</strong> became
        <strong>Chip-Chop mat AB</strong>. That same day, a new entity,
        <strong>Izakayakoi AB</strong>, was registered at
        <strong>c/o Restaurang Steakhouse Lilla Torg</strong>, linked to the
        Chudasama family.
      </p>

      <p>
        The company‚Äôs board included both
        <strong>Jayantilal Chudasama</strong> (age ~63) as Chairman and his son
        <strong>Alexander Saahil Chudasama</strong> as Director, confirming
        direct father‚Äìson involvement.
      </p>

      <p>
        Around <strong>17 December</strong>, <strong>Izakayakoi AB</strong> was
        granted a new serving license, shortly after being restructured under a
        different legal entity with new representatives.
      </p>

      <p>
        On <strong>19 December</strong>, media reports revealed that
        Skatteverket had uncovered unreported earnings linked to
        <strong>Izakayakoi AB</strong>, used to finance personal luxury
        expenses, including high-end shopping in London and New York.
      </p>

      <p>
        The owner was reported to have spent
        <strong>1.1 million SEK</strong> from undeclared income between 2006 and
        2008. Skatteverket considered these funds to be disguised salary income
        not declared or taxed correctly.
      </p>
      <h3>üìç <span style="font-size: 1.2rem; font-weight: 600">2009</span></h3>

      <p>
        On <strong>18 February</strong>,
        <strong>Chip-Chop mat AB</strong> officially changed its name to
        <strong>Yakisoba AB</strong> and simultaneously moved its registered
        office to <strong>Slottsgatan 12, 211 22 Malm√∂</strong>, consolidating
        its legal and administrative identity under a new structure.
      </p>

      <p>
        On <strong>9 May</strong>, former Izakayakoi owner
        <strong>Henrik Siebert</strong> was formally suspected of two financial
        crimes, following a deep audit by <strong>Skatteverket</strong>
        targeting cash register manipulation and undeclared revenues.
      </p>

      <p>
        Prosecutors stated that the alleged offenses could result in up to six
        years in prison. According to court filings, the case was still in early
        stages at the time.
      </p>
      <h3>üìç <span style="font-size: 1.2rem; font-weight: 600">2010</span></h3>

      <p>
        On <strong>8 August</strong>, a 34-year-old tourist was found
        unconscious after an altercation with Izakaya Koi‚Äôs security staff.
        Police opened an investigation for assault.
      </p>
      <h3>üìç <span style="font-size: 1.2rem; font-weight: 600">2011</span></h3>

      <p>
        On <strong>28 April 2011</strong>,
        <strong>Yakisoba AB</strong> (formerly known as
        <strong>Izakayakoi Aktiebolag</strong>) was formally declared in
        liquidation. This marked the legal end of the original corporate entity
        behind Izakaya Koi.
