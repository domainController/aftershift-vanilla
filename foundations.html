        </summary>
      
        <p><strong>This investigation relies on a multidisciplinary approach combining law, governance, financial tracing, and structural genealogy.</strong> It draws from investigative methods used in legal forensics, compliance auditing, and influence mapping.</p>
      
        <ul>
          <li><a href="glossary.html#corporate-genealogy"><strong>Corporate Genealogy</strong></a>: Tracks ownership succession, entity transitions, and long-term structural transfers (e.g., control, naming, rights).</li>

        <p>üìå These frameworks allow us to map <strong>who acts, who controls, who profits, and who represents</strong> ‚Äî even when paper trails suggest otherwise. Especially relevant in cases involving <strong>family businesses, founder-linked ventures, or parallel ownership networks</strong>.</p>
      </details>
      <p>
        <strong>What would later become Quan</strong> emerged <u>30 years ago</u> at <strong>Lilla Torg</strong>, driven by <strong>Henrik Siebert</strong> ‚Äî <em>concept development</em> and <u>Asian cuisine</u> ‚Äî and <strong>Saahil Chudasama</strong>, who ensured <em>legal and structural grounding</em>. <span style="font-weight: 500;">Neither could have done it alone.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Thereafter ‚Äî July 25, 1990 ‚Äì Michael Hagqvist</strong> (21) incorporates <a href="#">Etagegruppen AB</a> (556402-6697) to run the Malm√∂ nightclub <strong>Etage</strong>, launching what will become a regional hospitality group.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Years later, the company will absorb a key venue ‚Äî quietly closing the founding phase shaped by their combined efforts.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>May 19, 1991</strong>, Jayantil Chudasama (46)
        <strong>establishes the current format</strong> of the restaurant later
        known as <em>Steakhouse Lilla Torg</em>. In <strong>1994</strong>, he
        officially registers the name. His son <strong>Saahil (14)</strong> is
        present during this period,
        <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0"
          >a family that would later play a key role in Henrik‚Äôs journey</mark
        >.
      </p>

      <p><strong>April 16, 1993</strong> ‚Äî Just a few meters away, mixed Japanese‚ÄìSwedish brothers <strong>Toni</strong> (26) and <strong>Ronnie Petersson</strong> (22) open <strong>Izakaya Koi</strong>. They introduce the <em>izakaya</em> (Japanese pub) concept to Scania, blending <span class="highlight">sushi bar, DJ sets, and lounge energy</span> into a nightlife format still rare in Sweden.</p>

      <p>The venue is split across two levels: a street-level restaurant with a terrace, and an <strong>upstairs cocktail bar and dancefloor</strong>. It quickly became a <span class="highlight">trendy nightlife spot in Malm√∂</span>.</p>

      <h3>üìå <span style="font-size: 1.2rem; font-weight: 600">2004</span></h3>
      <p>
        On <strong>November 19</strong>, <strong>Henrik</strong> is officially
        registered as a <em>Board Member</em> of
        <strong>IZAKAYAKOI Aktiebolag (556462-5761)</strong> ‚Äî the original
        corporate entity behind Izakaya Koi's first iteration. He remains listed
        until the company‚Äôs <strong>liquidation in 2011</strong>, marking the
        legal end of this structure.
      </p>
      <p>
        At that time, the board consists of only two individuals: Henrik as
        <em>Board Member</em>, and a second person as
        <em>Deputy Board Member</em>. In addition, the structure includes one
        <em>Auditor</em> and one <em>Deputy Auditor</em>.
      </p>
      <h3>üìç <span style="font-size: 1.2rem; font-weight: 600">2006</span></h3>

      <p>
        On the night of <strong>12 October 2006 at 3 a.m.</strong>, during a
        study trip to London, a violent altercation occurred between
        <strong>Henrik Siebert</strong> and kitchen employee
        <strong>Frej S√∂derberg</strong> at a nightclub.
        <strong>Saahil Chudasama</strong>, not officially employed but close to
        the team, intervened physically.
      </p>

      <p>
        Employee <strong>Daniela Dahl</strong>, later registered at the same
        address as Henrik and eventually listed on the company‚Äôs board, was also
        present. The incident led to Frej‚Äôs dismissal shortly after the group
        returned to Malm√∂.
      </p>

      <p>
        On <strong>1 December</strong>, 26 members of the
        <strong>SAC union</strong> staged a public blockade of the restaurant.
        The protest led to a collective trial in
        <strong>September 2007</strong> at Malm√∂ District Court.
      </p>

      <h3>üìå <span style="font-size: 1.2rem; font-weight: 600">2007</span></h3>
      <p>
        üìÑ On December 31, the
        <a href="/documents/Annual_report_2007-12-31.pdf" target="_blank"
          ><strong>Annual Report</strong></a
        >
        shows a shift in trajectory: turnover reaches 10.99M SEK, but the
        company records a loss of <strong>‚àí248K SEK</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >The decline in profit following a record surplus the year
          before</strong

          >artificial earnings inflation or concealed cash outflows</span
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        Governance remains minimal: Henrik is the only Board Member, joined only
        by a <em>Deputy Board Member</em> and a formal audit pair.
        <span style="background-color: #e5e7eb"
          >No operational management is documented</span
        >.
      </p>
      <h3>üìç <span style="font-size: 1.2rem; font-weight: 600">2008</span></h3>

      <p>
        On <strong>16 January 2008</strong>, the Swedish Labour Court ruled that
        Frej S√∂derberg was lawfully dismissed for serious misconduct after
        initiating a physical altercation.
      </p>

      <p>
        The court acknowledged legal violations by the employer and awarded:
        <strong>15,000 SEK</strong> for procedural breach (lack of written
        notice and union consult), and <strong>5,000 SEK</strong> for failure to
        issue a written contract.
      </p>
      <p>
        The SAC union was ordered to pay <strong>139,000 SEK</strong> in legal
        fees, to reimburse the opposing party‚Äôs litigation and attorney costs.
      </p>

      <p>
        On <strong>26 November 2008</strong>, <strong>Realtid</strong> reported
        that <strong>Skatteverket</strong> had frozen
        <strong>Izakaya Koi</strong>‚Äôs bank accounts and revoked its alcohol
        license due to massive bookkeeping fraud. Estimated tax debt reached
        <strong>905,780 SEK</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        On <strong>9 December</strong>,
        <strong>Izakayakoi Aktiebolag</strong> became
        <strong>Chip-Chop mat AB</strong>. That same day, a new entity,
        <strong>Izakayakoi AB</strong>, was registered at
        <strong>c/o Restaurang Steakhouse Lilla Torg</strong>, linked to the
        Chudasama family.
      </p>

      <p>
        The company‚Äôs board included both
        <strong>Jayantilal Chudasama</strong> (age ~63) as Chairman and his son
        <strong>Alexander Saahil Chudasama</strong> as Director, confirming
        direct father‚Äìson involvement.
      </p>

      <p>
        Around <strong>17 December</strong>, <strong>Izakayakoi AB</strong> was
        granted a new serving license, shortly after being restructured under a
        different legal entity with new representatives.
      </p>

      <p>
        On <strong>19 December</strong>, media reports revealed that
        Skatteverket had uncovered unreported earnings linked to
        <strong>Izakayakoi AB</strong>, used to finance personal luxury
        expenses, including high-end shopping in London and New York.
      </p>

      <p>
        The owner was reported to have spent
        <strong>1.1 million SEK</strong> from undeclared income between 2006 and
        2008. Skatteverket considered these funds to be disguised salary income
        not declared or taxed correctly.
      </p>
      <h3>üìç <span style="font-size: 1.2rem; font-weight: 600">2009</span></h3>

      <p>
        On <strong>18 February</strong>,
        <strong>Chip-Chop mat AB</strong> officially changed its name to
        <strong>Yakisoba AB</strong> and simultaneously moved its registered
        office to <strong>Slottsgatan 12, 211 22 Malm√∂</strong>, consolidating
        its legal and administrative identity under a new structure.
      </p>

      <p>
        On <strong>9 May</strong>, former Izakayakoi owner
        <strong>Henrik Siebert</strong> was formally suspected of two financial
        crimes, following a deep audit by <strong>Skatteverket</strong>
        targeting cash register manipulation and undeclared revenues.
      </p>

      <p>
        Prosecutors stated that the alleged offenses could result in up to six
        years in prison. According to court filings, the case was still in early
        stages at the time.
      </p>
      <h3>üìç <span style="font-size: 1.2rem; font-weight: 600">2010</span></h3>

      <p>
        On <strong>8 August</strong>, a 34-year-old tourist was found
        unconscious after an altercation with Izakaya Koi‚Äôs security staff.
        Police opened an investigation for assault.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>On June 18</strong>, the five-star <strong>Renaissance Hotel Malm√∂</strong> opens its doors ‚Äî the first <span class="highlight">Marriott-branded location in Sweden</span>. Operated by <u>Luxury Hotels International Sweden AB</u> (org. no. <span class="highlight">559182-9386</span>), the hotel is based at <strong>M√§ster Johansgatan 15</strong>, where <u>Quan will later operate</u>.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          The hotel features the <strong>Rosen Bar & Dining</strong>, a venue known for blending <span class="highlight">contemporary Swedish cuisine</span> with <u>Spanish influences</u>, focused on seasonal and local ingredients.
          </p>

      <h3>üìç <span style="font-size: 1.2rem; font-weight: 600">2011</span></h3>

      <p>
        On <strong>28 April 2011</strong>,
        <strong>Yakisoba AB</strong> (formerly known as
        <strong>Izakayakoi Aktiebolag</strong>) was formally declared in
        liquidation. This marked the legal end of the original corporate entity
        behind Izakaya Koi.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-size: 1.2em">üìç <strong>2012</strong></span>
      </p>
      <p>

        <strong>On January 17</strong>, <strong>Saahil Chudasama</strong> (32)
        commissions the creation of a company named
        <strong>Saahil AB</strong> via
        <a href="notes.html#shelf" class="subtle-link">Bolagsstiftarna</a>, a
        <span class="highlight">Swedish shelf company provider</span>. A month
        later, <strong>Sahar</strong> (32) is formally added as deputy board
        member ‚Äî
        <u>her first trace in the corporate structures orbiting Quan</u>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>On January 19</strong>, the property housing the <strong>Renaissance Hotel Malm√∂</strong> is acquired for <span class="highlight">400 MSEK</span> by <strong>Fastighets AB Balder</strong> (org. no. <span class="highlight">556525-6905</span>). <u>The real estate transfer concerns the Rosen 9 property at M√§ster Johansgatan 15</u>, while <span class="highlight">Marriott remains tenant-operator under lease</span>.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>On April 13,</strong> the <u>Companies Registration Office</u> officially records a <strong>board and address change</strong> for <u>IzakayaKoi AB</u> (556765-3844). <strong>Michael Hagqvist</strong> (42), CEO of <u>Etagegruppen AB</u> (556402-6697), is appointed as <strong>sole administrator</strong>, with his wife <u>Emmy</u> listed as deputy member. This update formalizes the <span class="highlight">full integration of IzakayaKoi into the Etagegruppen structure</span>.
          </p>
          
          <p>
          The company‚Äôs official address is simultaneously changed to <strong>c/o Etagegruppen AB, Stortorget 6, 211 34 Malm√∂</strong>, directly aligning its operations with the group‚Äôs headquarters. From this point onward, <strong>IzakayaKoi AB becomes a wholly owned subsidiary</strong> of Etagegruppen AB, marking the end of the Peterson era and a <span class="highlight">strategic absorption into a new corporate lineage</span>.
