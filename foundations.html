        rate of <strong>4.75%</strong>.

        <strong>On the same day</strong>, Henrik signs a
        <strong>personal guarantee</strong> (<em>pantf√∂rskrivning</em>) pledging
        undefined business assets. This structure anticipates a capital split of

        Isakaya Koi group.

        On the night of <strong>12 October 2006 at 3 a.m.</strong>, during a
        study trip to London, a violent altercation occurred between
        <strong>Henrik Siebert</strong> and kitchen employee
        <strong>Frej S√∂derberg</strong> at a nightclub.
        <strong>Saahil Chudasama</strong>, not officially employed but close to
        the team, intervened physically.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>On October 23</strong>, <u>Frej S√∂derberg</u> was officially
        dismissed from the company for

      <p>
        On <strong>16 January 2008</strong>, the Swedish Labour Court ruled that
        Frej S√∂derberg was lawfully dismissed for serious misconduct after
        initiating a physical altercation.
      </p>

      <p>
        The court acknowledged legal violations by the employer and awarded:
        <strong>15,000 SEK</strong> for procedural breach (lack of written
        notice and union consult), and <strong>5,000 SEK</strong> for failure to
        issue a written contract.
      </p>
      <p>
        The SAC union was ordered to pay <strong>139,000 SEK</strong> in legal
        fees, to reimburse the opposing party‚Äôs litigation and attorney costs.
      </p>

      <p>
        On <strong>26 November</strong>, <strong>Realtid</strong> reported that
        <strong>Skatteverket</strong> had frozen <strong>Izakaya Koi</strong>‚Äôs
        bank accounts and revoked its alcohol license due to massive bookkeeping
        fraud. Estimated tax debt reached <strong>905,780 SEK</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        On 26 November, Izakayakoi Aktiebolag received a payment of
        <strong>6.8 million SEK</strong> recorded as an asset transfer. Later
        that same day, <strong>approx. 1.9 million SEK</strong> were transferred
        out from the same account to its holding company, Isakaya AB.
      </p>

      <p>
        On <strong>9 December</strong>,
        <strong>Izakayakoi Aktiebolag</strong> became
        <strong>Chip-Chop mat AB</strong>. That same day, a new entity,
        <strong>Izakayakoi AB </strong> (org. no. 556765-3844), was registered
        at <strong>c/o Restaurang Steakhouse Lilla Torg</strong>, linked to the
        Chudasama family.
      </p>

      <p>
        The company‚Äôs board included both
        <strong>Jayantilal Chudasama</strong> (age ~63) as Chairman and his son
        <strong>Alexander Saahil Chudasama</strong> as Director, confirming
        direct father‚Äìson involvement.
      </p>

      <p>
        Around <strong>17 December</strong>, <strong>Izakayakoi AB</strong> was
        granted a new serving license, shortly after being restructured under a
        different legal entity with new representatives.
      </p>

      <p>
        On <strong>19 December</strong>, media reports revealed that
        Skatteverket had uncovered unreported earnings linked to
        <strong>Izakayakoi AB</strong>, used to finance personal luxury
        expenses, including high-end shopping in London and New York.
      </p>

      <p>
        The owner was reported to have spent
        <strong>1.1 million SEK</strong> from undeclared income between 2006 and
        2008. Skatteverket considered these funds to be disguised salary income
        not declared or taxed correctly.

        targeting cash register manipulation and undeclared revenues.
