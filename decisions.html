              This page outlines the <strong>decision-making logic</strong> that
              shapes my choices ‚Äî cities, careers, relationships, long-term
              commitments. Not just biography: it‚Äôs my
              <em>operating system</em>.
            </p>

            <p>
              These are

              >
              ‚Äî distilled over a decade, structured like internal algorithms.
              Each governs how I evaluate options, resolve tension, and preserve
              clarity under pressure.
            </p>

            <p>
              It‚Äôs not abstract theory. It‚Äôs a
              <strong>framework for coherence</strong> ‚Äî a way to avoid passive
              drift and act with strategic intent. In
              <strong>legal contexts</strong>, this qualifies as a
              <a href="#" class="note-link">Statement of Grounds</a>: a
              structured justification for voluntary rupture under constraint.
            </p>

            <p>
              Many of these heuristics were
              <strong>inspired or reinforced</strong> by thinkers like

        <strong>At 32</strong>, after the
        <a href="#" class="note-link">2008 crisis</a>, I began
        <strong>questioning the structures of power</strong>. That same period
        ignited a shift in awareness ‚Äî a <u>conscious break from inertia</u>,
        blending social insight with metaphysical doubt.
      </p>

      <p>
        Two thinkers catalyzed that wake-up call:
        <a href="#" class="subtle-link">Alain Soral</a> ‚Äî whose early
        provocations cracked the surface ‚Äî and
        <a href="#" class="subtle-link">Jacqueline Bousquet</a>, who opened the
        metaphysical gate. I later moved on, but the rupture started there.
      </p>

      <p>
        At <strong>32</strong>, I didn‚Äôt just begin
        <strong>questioning the structures of power</strong>. That moment also
        triggered a deeper shift ‚Äî <u>a modernized mental posture</u>, blending
        social awareness with metaphysical curiosity. Until then, I had mostly
        moved by inertia. From that point, I began designing my direction.

      <p>
        <strong>In 2012</strong>, I entered what I would later call my
        <strong>35‚Äì45 sequence</strong>: a phase of <strong>rejection</strong> ‚Äî
        first of the <strong>corporate world</strong>, then the
        <strong>welfare state</strong>. My first move was
        <strong>Berlin</strong>, driven by a search for <u>peace of mind</u>,
        away from <u>status games</u> and <u>toxic patterns</u>.

      <p>
        Before any ‚Äúgrowth,‚Äù I had already begun reading extensively on
        <u>geopolitics</u>, <u>economic systems</u>, and
        <u>power structures</u> during my final years in France I needed to
        <strong>understand the architecture of constraint</strong>. As early as
        <strong>age 33</strong>, I had already started to decode the
        <strong>political, economic and social architecture</strong> around me ‚Äî
        the first axis of thought I would later define as
        <strong>System Decryption</strong>.. I spent years decoding power
        systems‚Äîpolitics, media, finance, welfare‚Äîuntil I saw how consent was
        manufactured. It wasn‚Äôt paranoia. It was self-defense.

        I didn‚Äôt want guidance. I wanted to
        <strong>build my own compass</strong>. I believed there had to be a
        way‚Äîthrough reading, trial, and structure‚Äîto design a protocol for life.
        I wasn‚Äôt looking for spiritual peace. I was looking for
        <u>clarity, autonomy, and inner leverage</u>.

        <p>
          I never liked the word ‚Äústartup.‚Äù What fascinated me was the logic of
          <strong>venture creation</strong>: building something radically new,
          with full creative freedom, in a space of uncertainty and high
          asymmetry. I wanted <strong>leverage without permission</strong>‚Äîa way
          to test ideas, own the upside, and stay free. It wasn‚Äôt just about
          innovation. It was about
          <u>the possibility of wealth through chaos</u>.

        <section id="heuristic-alignment">
          <p>
            <strong>Heuristic Logic</strong> ‚Äî Some of my choices were shaped by
            <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0"
              >Naval‚Äôs decision heuristics</mark
            >, others were my own. I credit him especially on
            <u>location and peace of mind</u>. His lens helped me turn instinct
            into structure.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>What I do</strong> ‚Äî I chose <u>tech</u> because it allowed
            remote work, low entry friction, and upward optionality. I wasn‚Äôt
            passionate at first. But it felt like a
            <strong>survival heuristic</strong> that fit my life constraints.
            Later, I followed projects that gave me
            <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0">mental clarity</mark>, not
            just income.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Where I live</strong> ‚Äî After Hong Kong, I
            <strong>never returned to the same country twice</strong>. That‚Äôs my
            own rule. Naval helped me sharpen it:
            <u>location defines trajectory</u>. Singapour isn‚Äôt just a place ‚Äî
            it‚Äôs a conscious bet on social relief, business frictionlessness,
            and clean structure.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Who I‚Äôm with</strong> ‚Äî From 40 onward, I became radically
            intentional in relationships. I select for
            <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0"
              >compatibility with my direction</mark
            >. Before, it was inertia. Now it‚Äôs projection. <u>Sara</u> was a
            turning point ‚Äî I‚Äôll link that fragment soon.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>My own heuristics</strong> ‚Äî
            <em>If it‚Äôs easy, it‚Äôs wrong</em>.
            <em>Choose change over comfort</em>. And
            <strong
              >never endure long-term toxicity for short-term safety</strong
            >. That‚Äôs what led me to leave well-paying jobs, cut ties fast, and
            avoid systems that erode clarity.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Entrepreneurship</strong> ‚Äî For me, it's not ambition. It‚Äôs
            a <u>peace strategy</u>. I needed out of the salary maze, and into
            focus-based leverage. I saw work not as status ‚Äî but as structure.

        <p>
          At <strong>41</strong>, , I landed in <strong>Stockholm</strong> with
          little plan‚Äîhomeless but driven. I was coming out of months of
          personal disarray, and for the first time, two desires emerged
          clearly:

        </p>

        <p>
          That‚Äôs where I met <strong>L√©o</strong> at a startup incubator. We
          co-founded a tech project. Though I lacked technical skills, the
