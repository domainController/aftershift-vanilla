      <h1>Personal Operating Principle</h1>
      <!--

            <strong
              >Personal Operating Principle ‚Äî Strategic Alignment
              Statement</strong
            >
          </summary>

          <p>
            This section formalizes the mindset that governed my exit: not a
            failure, but an act of alignment. It explains why I chose dignity
            over endurance, and inner coherence over passive compliance.
          </p>

          <p>
            In the field of labour law, this qualifies as a
            <strong>Statement of Grounds</strong>: a motivated justification
            explaining the rational and ethical logic behind a voluntary
            departure under moral strain.
          </p>

          <p>
            It also falls within the tradition of
            <strong>Operating Principles</strong> as used by entrepreneurs and
            creators ‚Äî from Naval Ravikant to Philippe Guillement ‚Äî where action
            is dictated by resonance, not repetition.
          </p>

          <p>
            In my case, risk-taking was not recklessness. It was the only way to
            preserve momentum, clarity, and direction. Remaining would have
            meant dissonance, collapse, and toxic assimilation.
          </p>

          <p>
            My decision to leave was based on years of introspective discipline,
            exposure to metaphysical thinking, and a conscious rejection of
            environments that obstruct future probabilities.
          </p>

          <p>
            This is not a manifesto. It is a legal and personal record of
            coherence: a structured refusal to allow short-term dysfunction to
            hijack long-term integrity.
          </p>

      <p>
        During summer <strong>2000</strong> (age 23) I was studying English at
        <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Nanterre_University"
          class="subtle-link"
          >Paris-Nanterre</a
        >University while taking an introductory Dutch course. I replied to a
        Dutch student's home-swap offer, living in her Amsterdam room while she
        stayed in my studio near Paris.
      </p>

      <p>
        In <strong>2002</strong> (age 25) while living in Vichy I met a German
        woman on an intensive French course who invited me for a brief holiday;
        the visit stretched to about eight months, during which I mainly worked
        on a construction site and also taught French.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Mannheim I felt no hostile or curious looks‚Äîonly the freedom of being
        an ordinary person. Surrounded by well-travelled, open people, I was
        viewed in conversation as an articulate, intelligent Frenchman rather
        than through a ‚ÄúBlack‚Äù label.
      </p>

      <p>
        From that time I realised that
        <u><strong>living abroad would become part of my journey</strong></u
        >: it revealed <u>new opportunities</u>, and
        <u>returning home</u> became merely a brief pause before I set off again
        to <u>explore fresh perspectives</u>.
      </p>

          style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 8px"
        />
      </div>

      <p>
        In <strong>2004</strong> (age 27) I returned to the Netherlands and
        worked in several call centres. Nearing thirty (age 28) I began IT
        training to give my career structure. In
        <strong>December 2006</strong> (age 29) HP hired me near Barcelona
        before I had even finished the course.
      </p>

      <p>
        That marked the start of what I consider my only stable phase in the
        professional world ‚Äî a five-year stretch. I spent 18 months in Spain,
        then 12 months at IBM in Amsterdam. Back in Paris, I worked as a
        ‚Äúconsultant‚Äù, including nearly 2.5 years at Sanofi, a major
        pharmaceutical group.
      </p>

      <p>
        I realized I couldn‚Äôt go any further without losing myself ‚Äî despite a
        career that looked financially promising. It felt like living inside a
        Houellebecq or Kafka novel: alienation so dense it could only end in
        madness or collapse.
