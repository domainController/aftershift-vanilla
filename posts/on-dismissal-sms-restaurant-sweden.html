      At <strong>6:35 AM</strong> on <strong>December 14, 2024</strong>, after a work shift that ended slightly earlier than usual, I sent a message to management proposing to take a short break. The message included an additional note: if the proposal was not accepted, they could interpret the text as a resignation.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      Several hours later, a manager acknowledged receipt and said the matter would be discussed. No follow-up occurred during the day.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      On the following day, <strong>December 15</strong>, at <strong>11:30 AM</strong>, I was notified by SMS that the management had decided to “part ways.” This article reconstructs the events, documents the exchanges, and examines the legal and procedural implications of the termination.

            In December 2024, I was employed as a dishwasher at <strong>Quan</strong>, a restaurant located inside the <strong>Elite Hotel Esplanade</strong> in Malmö. Although I had no written contract, I worked regular late-night shifts, typically finishing between <strong>4:30 and 5:30 AM</strong>, with occasional earlier or longer closings.
            </p>
            
            <p>
            I had no direct contact with the hotel’s administration. My only supervisor was a woman named <strong>Mina</strong>, who acted as manager on-site. She gave instructions, managed schedules, and appeared to oversee daily operations, though her exact formal title or role within the company was never disclosed.
            </p>  
            <div class="context-block">
             
                <p>
                  From <strong>November 23 to December 15, 2024</strong>, I worked as a <strong>dishwasher</strong> in a restaurant located inside a <strong>luxury hotel</strong> in Malmö, known for being fully booked several weeks in advance. The <strong>onboarding was informal</strong>: no written contract, no introduction to rules or expectations, and no outline of duties. The work relied on informal verbal cues and implicit norms.
                </p>
              
                <p>
                  There was <strong>no team-wide communication channel</strong>, aside from the shared schedule system (Personalkollen). Instructions came mainly from <strong>Emil</strong>, a manager operating mostly via SMS. Floor-level authority, however, seemed to rest with <strong>Mina</strong>, whose role was never explicitly defined, yet who visibly directed staff on site. I was never formally introduced to her or briefed on her function.
                </p>
              
                <p>
                  On <strong>December 14</strong>, I made <strong>several verbal attempts</strong> to clarify my role, especially regarding a test period where I was unofficially expected to replace the external cleaning team. Over the span of a few hours, I addressed Mina multiple times, asking for a short exchange. My requests were either <strong>ignored</strong>, deflected ("go speak to Magnus"), or met with ironic laughter.
                </p>
              
                <p>
                  In one instance, she <strong>walked away laughing</strong> with a colleague after I asked a basic question. Another time, she responded with a dismissive look. Only once—when noticing my visible disappointment—did she give a brief answer in front of another staff member. By the end of the shift, I was physically strained from repeated hand injuries and carrying a significant <strong>sleep debt</strong>, and mentally affected by the persistent <strong>lack of recognition</strong> and clarity.
                </p>
                <p>
                  That evening, I attempted several times to speak with <strong>Mina</strong>, seeking clarity on my duties — especially regarding the trial replacement of the external Friday cleaning service. She reminded me I was still on a <strong>trial period</strong> and said it wasn’t the right time. I acknowledged this and backed off initially.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                  Later, when the environment seemed calmer, I tried again. I had become more familiar with the team and the place, and I felt increasingly confident initiating that kind of exchange. But she either avoided me, dismissed the request, or responded with sarcasm. One interaction even ended with a smirk and her walking away mid-sentence.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                  Despite these attempts, <strong>Mina</strong> had earlier encouraged me to take on extra duties, and the head chef had said he might make me the “<strong>main guy</strong>.” Still, I received no clear instructions. <strong>Erik</strong>, the other manager visible in media, remained silent. He never introduced himself formally nor spoke about work. The two managers seemed to operate independently and barely acknowledged each other. I found myself <strong>isolated and uncertain who to approach</strong>.
