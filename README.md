# SignalMemo-Infra

> 🧭 A **tactical artifact** to provoke internal mirroring among CxOs (CLE, CLO, DRH),  
> probe LP/GP narrative tensions, and deploy a supervisory narrative format without direct confrontation.

## 🧠 What is it?

SignalMemo-Infra is the **formal structure** of a strategic memo standard, designed to:
- be dense, forkable, and diagonally readable,
- trigger questions and self-audit without external consultants,
- encode moral and operational tensions without naming actors.

This repo hosts the **protocol, format and canonical markdown structure** of the SignalMemo initiative.  
It’s the backbone — not a use case, not an instance, not a blog.
