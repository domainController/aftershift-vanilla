      <h1>Profil</h1>
      <section class="max-w-3xl mx-auto p-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          My name is <strong>Patrice Kenmoé</strong>, I’m 47 years old. Born in
          <strong>Lyon</strong>, of <strong>Bamiléké</strong> ethnicity, I’ve
          lived in six countries. After three years in Ireland, I moved to
          <strong>Sweden</strong> on April 21st, 2022.
        </p>

        <p>
          At <strong>25</strong>, I left France for the first time: destination
          <strong>the Netherlands</strong>, where I worked in several call
          centers. Back in France, I returned to sales, then discovered the job
          of <strong>hotliner</strong>, my first real gateway into IT.
        </p>

        <p>
          At <strong>29</strong>, I started an IT training course, and before
          finishing it, I was recruited by <strong>HP in Barcelona</strong>,
          then <strong>IBM in Amsterdam</strong>. I spent
          <strong>two and a half years abroad</strong>, before returning to
          France at <strong>32</strong>, where I worked as a consultant at
          <strong>Sanofi</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          At <strong>35</strong>, in conflict with my values, I walked away from
          everything. I left the highest-paying job I’d ever had to move to
          <strong>Berlin</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Between <strong>35 and 45</strong>, I worked barely a year in total. I
          sometimes lived <strong>without stable housing</strong>, sometimes in
          <strong>emergency shelters</strong>, sometimes
          <strong>in rentals or with a partner</strong>. It was a time of
          <strong>rupture</strong>, of deep questioning, when I began to shape
          my own principles of life.
        </p>

        <p>
          At 45, I moved to Sweden. I spent nearly a year in Gothenburg, then
          about 15 months in Stockholm, much of it in a relationship. For the
          past 6 months, I’ve been living in Malmö, where a
          <a href="/context.html">new chapter</a> has quietly started.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since March 21, I had
          <a
            href="https://github.com/domainController/openheart/commits/layout-v1-profile/"
            class="subtle-link"
            >begun</a
          >
          working on the development of a
          <a
            href="https://github.com/domainController/openheart"
            class="subtle-link"
            >dating app</a
          >
          mvp. But on April 13, I decided to put this work on hold in order to
          fully dedicate myself to the research, writing, and development of
          <strong>Aftershift.se</strong>.

        This space will soon host a series of written chronicles, drawing from
        my lived experience in Malmö's restaurant industry.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each article will explore two dimensions: the chronological unfolding of
        events, and a parallel legal reflection based on those facts.
      </p>

      <p class="teaser">
        First upcoming post: <strong>On dismissal by text</strong> — a
        reflection on the normalization of termination without explanation or
        documentation.
      </p>

      <p>
        Before launching the first entries, legal disclaimers and policy details
        are being finalized.

        <strong>The Unsocial Hours</strong> is a
        <strong>tactical-legal journal</strong> born out of systematic
        communication failure. From the first to the last shift, the employment
        relationship was marked by <strong>lack of transparency</strong>, lack
        of guidance, and the absence of any formal framework.
      </p>
      <p>
        This ongoing blog documents and analyzes a workplace where
        <strong>legitimate requests for clarity or payment</strong> were
        increasingly met with <strong>silence</strong> or
        <strong>hostility</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The journal was initiated following a
        <strong>dishwasher dismissal without a written contract</strong>, and
        remains active.
      </p>
      <p>
        The last interaction with the employer took place in
        <strong>mid-April 2025</strong>, when a counter-offer — equivalent to
        two weeks of salary — was made in an attempt to preempt a formal legal
        claim.

        <strong>This blog</strong> offers a personal investigation into a real
        labor conflict I experienced as a dishwasher in late 2024. Each post
        analyzes a key incident — such as a
        <a href="/posts/resignation-sms.html">dismissal by SMS</a> — and
        explores the
        <strong>legal, procedural, and ethical implications</strong>
        involved.<br /><br />
        It also provides a <strong>structured timeline of events</strong>,
        highlights <strong>contractual breaches</strong> and
        <strong>administrative irregularities</strong>, and reviews the
        <strong>legal obligations</strong> potentially violated.<br /><br />
        The approach combines <strong>factual narration</strong>,
        <strong>legal interpretation</strong>, and
        <strong>socio-professional reflection</strong>, to identify broader
        structural failures and accountability gaps.

        is also a space of
        <strong>personal training and experimentation</strong> — an initiation
        into legal reasoning, narrative structure, and stylistic clarity.
      </p>

      <p>
        Through this evolving exercise, it seeks to
        <strong>clarify damages</strong>, surface deeper conflict mechanisms,
        and <strong>outline actionable legal paths</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>The Unsocial Hours</strong> also serves as a pragmatic space for
        <strong>defense, documentation, and strategic anticipation</strong> in
        the face of opaque or hostile work environments.
      </p>

      <p>
        It seeks to
        <strong
          >echo the voice of those in the shadows of the labor market</strong
        >, especially in roles marked by high turnover, low visibility, or
        informal contracts — such as
        <strong>dishwashing and other back-of-house positions</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rather than merely narrate, this journal encourages
        <strong>cross-reference and pattern recognition</strong> — inviting
        comparisons, shared learning, and structured forms of response. It also
        aims to
        <strong>federate workers, legal minds, and isolated cases</strong>
        around common practices.
      </p>
      <p>
        A dedicated <a href="/contact">Contact & Collaboration Page</a> invites
        legal professionals, labor advisors, and independent contributors. See
        also the

      <p>
        <strong>The Unsocial Hours</strong> examines practical ways to engage
        legal standards through writing, structure, and visibility — especially
        in contexts where formal procedures are slow, unclear, or inaccessible.
        It encourages adaptive methods to address legal silence and aims to make
        labor justice more responsive to lived realities.

          <strong>About the title:</strong> <em>The Unsocial Hours</em> refers
          to <strong>late shifts</strong> and
          <strong>marginal work schedules</strong>, often excluded from
          <strong>mainstream labor protections</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          This expression echoes the Swedish term
          <em><strong>“obekväm arbetstid”</strong></em> (literally:
          <strong>“inconvenient working hours”</strong>), which inspired the
          initials “OB”. The journal title is both
          <strong>a nod to this legal category</strong>, and
          <strong
            >a reflection on how those hours often lead to social invisibility,
            legal opacity, and managerial impunity</strong
          >.

        <p>
          This part introduces the <em>narrative grid</em> — a
          <strong>pragmatic label</strong> for a three-part structure designed
          to trace key stages of a workplace conflict through structured
          narrative blocks.
        </p>
        <details open>
          <summary class="section-order">
            🧩 <strong>Part 1 — Narrative Structure of Fact</strong>
          </summary>

          <p>
            <strong>Function:</strong> This section explains
            <strong>how</strong>, <strong>when</strong>, and
            <strong>under what intent</strong> I entered the situation — by
            laying out the
            <strong>conditions, sequence, and strategic meaning</strong> that
            preceded the conflict.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Fields:</strong> This kind of structure appears as a
            <strong>case chronology</strong> (legal), a
            <strong>mission log</strong> (ops), or an
            <strong>incident report</strong> (HR). Comparable formats exist in
            <em>investigative journalism</em> and
            <em>strategic consulting</em> (as practiced by firms like McKinsey,
            EY, or KPMG).
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Usage:</strong> Lawyers, auditors, and compliance agents use
            such forms to detect
            <a href="/glossary.html#managerial-drift">managerial drift</a>,
            <a href="/glossary.html#accountability-gap">accountability gaps</a>,
            or signs of
            <a href="/glossary.html#proxy-communication">proxy communication</a>
            in hierarchical systems.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Adaptation:</strong> This structure serves as a form of
            early positioning. It anticipates legal tactics aiming to minimize
            damage by framing the claimant as incoherent, fragile, or unserious.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Structure:</strong> The narrative follows a strict
            3-paragraph model: intent, chronology, and strategic framing. It
            presents no claim and no emotion — only a foundation.
          </p>

        <p><u>Strategic Relocation & System Entry</u></p>
        <p>
          After three years in Ireland, I began a strategic return through Nice
          and
          <a href="governance.html#governance-fragment" class="subtle-link"
            >Paris</a
          >, where I attempted to join a failing business led by a former
          friend. The plan—framed as a company revival—quickly revealed deeper
          structural issues (see
          <a href="governance.html#governance-fragment" class="subtle-link"
            >Governance Section</a
          >). After seven months, I left and chose to relocate to

          in April 2022, aiming for a more stable and transparent environment.
        </p>

        <p>
          I first settled in <strong>Gothenburg</strong>, where I stayed several
          months and briefly worked as an independent courier for
          <a href="https://www.foodora.se" class="subtle-link">Foodora</a>. This
          role enabled me to obtain a
          <strong>samordningsnummer</strong> (temporary number), and shortly
          after, a <strong>personnummer</strong> through formal employment.

        <p>
          Before leaving Gothenburg, I had already rented a
          <strong>coworking space</strong> where I began outlining long-term
          projects. This was my first professional space in Sweden—an anchor
          that typically signals the start of any personal rebuild.

          <p><u>Early Cohabitation & Mutual Dependence</u></p>
          <p>
            I met Sarah online shortly before relocating to Stockholm. Within
            two weeks, we moved in together—partly due to a strong connection,
            but mostly driven by mutual economic need. She had two children and
            had just lost her flatmate. I needed stable housing in Stockholm. It
            felt mutually logical.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="context-block">
          <p><u>Shared Budget & Informal Agreement</u></p>
          <p>
            From my first full paycheck, I contributed up to
            <strong>16,000 SEK/month</strong> toward rent, food, car fuel,
            insurance, and more. This amount also included an informal
            reimbursement for the initial months she had supported me.
          </p>
          <p>
            We had a verbal agreement: either we would build a family, or we
            would build a company. This was my condition for long-term
            involvement. I called it our <em>pilot agreement</em>.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="context-block">
          <p><u>Communication Challenges & “Pilotalks”</u></p>
          <p>
            From the outset, I insisted on structured communication. I created
            the concept of <em>Pilotalks</em>: one hour of discussion every
            evening, and weekend walks to reflect and recalibrate. These efforts
            were short-lived. Over time, communication degraded. My repeated
            attempts to create a weekly agenda or set shared goals were avoided.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="context-block">
          <p><u>Business Initiative & Weekend Withdrawal</u></p>
          <p>
            We rented a shared office to develop a review-based platform. I
            covered around <strong>75% of the costs</strong>, and she was to
            contribute time. Although enthusiastic at first, she soon
            disengaged—particularly on weekends, which she reserved for leisure.
          </p>
          <p>
            I tried to bridge our differences by aligning on values, building a
            company culture, researching competitors, and setting a shared
            vision. I proposed working sessions to define purpose, mission, and
            market niche. Despite pockets of motivation, the consistent effort
            never followed.

        <section class="context-block">
          <p><u>Imbalance & Emotional Weight</u></p>
          <p>
            I began to notice deeper misalignments: parenting philosophies far
            from my own, unresolved emotional burdens from her past, and
            recurring disrespect—from both her and her children. Her
            ex-partner’s presence added stress, often interrupting our daily
            rhythm or affecting her mood.
          </p>
          <p>
            I felt reduced to a provider. The trust I offered was used for
            comfort, not growth. Meanwhile, I was contributing over
            <strong>three-quarters of my income</strong>, emotionally and
            financially committed to something that wasn’t moving forward.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="context-block">
          <p><u>Departure & Closure</u></p>
          <p>
            I lived with her for 14 months. When neither a family nor a business
            seemed possible, I made the decision to leave. My departure was
            clean, without conflict. I never demanded anything in return.
          </p>
          <p>
            I retain full documentation of my financial contributions. I believe
            we helped each other for a time, but when the terms silently
            collapsed, I chose to walk away and realign with my path.

        <p><u>Using Restaurants as a Launch Pad</u></p>
        <p>
          The move was deliberate. My goal was to stabilize my legal and
          financial status while gradually preparing for
          <strong>independent tech work</strong>. I chose restaurants as a
          <strong>strategic entry point</strong>: quick cashflow, proof of
          address, and immediate access to the
          <u>Swedish system</u> (personnummer, unemployment insurance, banking).
        </p>
        <p><u>Last Job Before Quan</u></p>
        <p>
          Before joining Quan, I worked for 14 months as a dishwasher at
          <strong>Da Peppe Due</strong>, a well-known pizzeria in Stockholm. The
          environment was relaxed yet functional. When tasks were done, it was
          acceptable to rest, scroll through Instagram, or sit in the private
          dining room until the next rush. What mattered was being ready when
          needed, and responsive under pressure.
        </p>

        <p>
          My chef’s philosophy was simple: the restaurant should work smoothly
          <u>without his constant presence</u>. That meant trusting the staff,
          avoiding drama, and preventing complaints. We were never monitored for
          how we spent our downtime. We ate what we wanted. I regularly
          photographed my meals, which ranged from lasagna to steak, and even
          considered creating an Instagram account just for them. Salaries were
          fair—and sometimes higher than expected.
        </p>

        <section class="narrative-comparison">
          <p>
            I left for strategic reasons, but I never felt disposable. That job
            left me with a sense of
            <strong>trust, dignity, and horizontal respect</strong>. It shaped
            my expectations—and helped me detect when the opposite was
            happening.
          </p>

          <p>
            Despite this, the city's
            <strong>stress, noise, and compressed energy</strong> had become too
            much. I needed calmer surroundings, both socially and mentally.
            <strong>Malmö offered a logical reset</strong>: softer social
            dynamics, fewer frictions, and a milder climate—one I knew would be
            safer to endure if housing became uncertain again.
          </p>
        </section>

        <p><u>End of Phase One</u></p>

        <p>
          I had regained everything I needed materially after nearly a decade of
          precariousness. I had secured eligibility for unemployment benefits.
          But remaining a <strong>dishwasher</strong> any longer would have
          meant accepting a symbolic label I could no longer carry. The second
          phase of my strategy had to begin.
        </p>

        <p><u>Phase Two – From Precarity to Readiness</u></p>
        <p>
          In May 2024, after a breakup, I entered a period of
          <strong

              href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rtj9b9BVrquGxQHegjPrs6o0ZP-9BRoR/view?usp=sharing"
              >housing precarity</a
            ></strong
          >
          in Stockholm. I no longer had stable shelter, but I retained 24/7
          access to a <strong>coworking space</strong>. The following month, in
          June, I worked in two restaurants and earned
          <strong>32,000 SEK</strong>—my highest official monthly income.
        </p>

        <p>
          This marked the start of <strong>Phase Two</strong>: securing the
          final tools for <strong>tech entrepreneurship</strong>. I aimed to
          acquire a car, an ultra-wide monitor, a backup laptop, and
          <strong
            ><a
              href="https://verksamt.se/en/setting-up/choose-business-type/limited-company"
              >25,000 SEK in incorporation funds</a
            ></strong
          >. Once covered, <strong>Phase Three</strong>—building the
          company—could begin.
        </p>

        <p><u>Arrival in Malmö</u></p>
        <p>
          I arrived in Malmö on <strong>November 1, 2024</strong>, determined to
          resume work in a higher-standard kitchen. I shortlisted venues with
          <strong>top-rated service reviews</strong>, hoping to find a place
          where my obsessive attention to detail would be seen as an asset—not a
          flaw, as in my last job.

      <h1>The Price of Research</h1>

      <p class="intro">
        This page outlines the time, money, tools, and investigative choices
        made to compile and document this archive. From data extraction and
        translation to document purchase and workflow traceability — everything
        is logged.
      </p>

      <h2>📄 Document Acquisition Costs</h2>

      </ul>

      <h2>🔍 Motivation</h2>
      <p>
        Transparency isn't just a principle — it's an audit trail. This section
        exists so that any restaurateur, journalist, or curious party can
        understand the effort behind the inquiry. It also allows readers to
        evaluate the seriousness of the method, and the value of making silence
        speak.

        <strong>Why this page exists:</strong><br />
        This page curates letters and legal communications received in response
        to our investigation. It offers the reader a glimpse into the language,
        tone, and strategies used — from veiled threats to formal settlements.

        <h2>📄 April 2025 — Letter from Head Chef Henrik Ling</h2>

        <p><strong>Sender:</strong> Henrik Kling, Head Chef at Quan / HSSC Event AB<br />
        <strong>Recipient:</strong> AfterShift Editor (K.P.)<br />
        <strong>Date:</strong> April 17, 2025<br />
        <strong>Method:</strong> Attached PDF, sent via personal email, no subject line</p>
        
        <p>
        This letter was sent in response to an initial legal notice issued by the editor of this site in early April 2025. The notice related to delayed employer certificates, potential unlawful dismissal, and informal coercion following a trial contract termination.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Instead of receiving a reply from legal counsel or management, the company delegated the response to <strong>Henrik Kling</strong>, the <em>head chef and senior figure in the kitchen brigade</em>. The letter arrived as a simple PDF attachment, with no explanatory message or subject line. This form and channel of response were perceived as <strong>dismissive and non-serious</strong>, which prompted a second formal notice from the claimant — never opened by the company.
        </p>
        
        <blockquote style="border-left: 4px solid #ccc; padding-left: 1em; font-style: italic; color: #555;">
        “It is reasonable to interpret this response not as an official legal stance, but rather as a delegated placeholder — written quickly between two shifts, perhaps with the assistance of a generative language model.”<br /> 
        – Editorial Note
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>
        The letter offers no legal rebuttal, acknowledges no facts, and closes with a vague offer of two weeks’ compensation — unsigned and without legal formatting.
        </p>

      <h1>Defense FAQ</h1>

      <h2>1. What is the legal nature of this site?</h2>
      <p>
        This site is a civic archive authored by an individual residing in Sweden. 
        It documents first-hand labor experiences, backed by personal and official records. 
        It is non-commercial, non-affiliated, and protected under Swedish and European legal frameworks 
        (freedom of expression, right to document, public interest).
      </p>

      <h2>2. Are personal names or companies exposed?</h2>
      <p>
        Names are mentioned only when they are part of:
        <ul>
          <li>Public registries (e.g., Bolagsverket, Skatteverket)</li>
          <li>Legally documented employer roles or decision-making positions</li>
          <li>Situations with direct operational or legal relevance to the grievance</li>
        </ul>
        Where appropriate, names may be anonymized or partially redacted.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Why is this public and not private?</h2>
      <p>
        Legal communication channels have been exhausted or met with silence, threats, or procedural evasion. Not all damage is litigable. Public documentation allows patterns to emerge, informs others in similar situations, and serves as a civil ledger of misconduct or procedural failure.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Is this defamatory?</h2>
      <p>
        No. Every element is:
        <ul>
          <li>Backed by documents, screenshots, or official filings</li>
          <li>Presented in a structured, cautious, and legally filtered tone</li>
          <li>Free from insult or distortion</li>
        </ul>
        If an error is found, it may be corrected upon request.
      </p>

      <h2>5. What if you are mentioned?</h2>
      <p>
        You may:
        <ul>
          <li>Submit a factual correction or clarification</li>
          <li>Provide a verifiable rebuttal or timeline</li>
          <li>Request anonymization if proportionate and justified</li>
        </ul>
        Contact: <a href="mailto:patrice@aftershift.se">patrice@aftershift.se</a> or use the <a href="/contact.html">contact form</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Can this be cited or reused?</h2>
      <p>
        Yes. Provided that:
        <ul>
          <li>AfterShift.se is mentioned as the source</li>
          <li>No modification is made to the excerpts</li>
          <li>The context of citation respects proportionality and good faith</li>
        </ul>
        Journalists, academics, and legal professionals are welcome to contact the author for clarification.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Is this politically or union-affiliated?</h2>
      <p>
        No. The initiative is personal and independent. Any external reuse by union or political actors is not coordinated or solicited.
      </p>

      <h2>8. Why are some materials access-restricted?</h2>
<p>
  Some financial breakdowns, offshore documentation, or legal records are not published openly to preserve negotiation leverage, ensure editorial safety, or avoid premature exposure of sensitive data.
  These are accessible on a case-by-case basis through the <a href="/confidential.html">Confidential Insight Access</a> section, where requesters must identify themselves and explain their interest.
</p>

<h2>9. What happens if access is denied?</h2>
<p>
  Requests that do not meet minimal verification criteria will receive a formal rejection notice.
  This includes vague, unverifiable, or pseudonymous identities.
</p>
<p>
  The author reserves the right to deny access at their discretion, based on editorial and security considerations.
  Applicants are not added to any database, and rejected identities are not retained.

        <strong>Juniträdet 5 AB</strong> is formally incorporated under
        registration number <span class="highlight">556663-2161</span>. The
        structure is typical of

        provided by incorporation firms, with placeholder board members and
        auditors.
      </p>
      <p></p>

      <p>
        <strong>On July 2</strong>, Henrik Kei Siebert signs a
        <span class="highlight">4 million SEK loan</span> agreement on behalf of
        <u>Juniträdet 5 AB</u>, officially described as
        <em>"u ä t KOI Holding AB"</em>. The contract is issued through
        <strong>SEB</strong>, for a term of
        <span class="highlight">5 years and 6 months</span> at a fixed interest
        rate of <strong>4.75%</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>On the same day</strong>, Henrik signs a
        <strong>personal guarantee</strong> (<em>pantförskrivning</em>) pledging
        undefined business assets. This structure anticipates a capital split of
        <span class="highlight">90% / 10%</span> between Henrik and
        <u>Carl-Johan Östlund</u>, reflecting the future ownership of the
        Isakaya Koi group.
      </p>

      <p>
        On <strong>November 19</strong>, <strong>Henrik</strong> is officially
        registered as a <em>Board Member</em> of
        <strong>IZAKAYAKOI Aktiebolag (556462-5761)</strong> — the original
        corporate entity behind Izakaya Koi's first iteration. He remains listed
        until the company’s <strong>liquidation in 2011</strong>, marking the
        legal end of this structure.
      </p>

      <p>
        At that time, the board consists of only two individuals: Henrik as
        <em>Board Member</em>,<strong> Robert Carl-Johan Östlund</strong> as
        <u>Deputy Board Member</u>, and <u>Mikael Cressy</u> as Auditor.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>On November 22</strong>, <u>Juniträdet 5 AB</u> officially
        changes its name to <strong>Izakaya AB</strong>. The board at that time
        consists of <strong>Henrik (27)</strong> as Board Member and
        <strong>Erich Karl Siebert (63)</strong> as <u>Deputy Board Member</u>.
        The appointed auditor is <u>Berth Åke Knutsson</u>.

      <p>
        On the night of <strong>12 October 2006 at 3 a.m.</strong>, during a
        study trip to London, a violent altercation occurred between
        <strong>Henrik Siebert</strong> and kitchen employee
        <strong>Frej Söderberg</strong> at a nightclub.
        <strong>Saahil Chudasama</strong>, not officially employed but close to
        the team, intervened physically.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>On October 23</strong>, <u>Frej Söderberg</u> was officially
        dismissed from the company for
        <span class="highlight">personal reasons</span>, following the trip

        <a href="#note-sac-union">26 members of SAC Syndikalisterna</a>
        (<em>a Malmö-based anarcho-syndicalist union</em>) staged a blockade of
        Izakaya Koi in protest of Frej Söderberg’s dismissal. The action,
        triggered by alleged labor law violations, led to a high-profile
        collective trial in <strong>September 2007</strong>.

      <p>
        On <strong>16 January 2008</strong>, the Swedish Labour Court ruled that
        Frej Söderberg was lawfully dismissed for serious misconduct after
        initiating a physical altercation.
      </p>

      <p>
        The court acknowledged legal violations by the employer and awarded:
        <strong>15,000 SEK</strong> for procedural breach (lack of written
        notice and union consult), and <strong>5,000 SEK</strong> for failure to
        issue a written contract.
      </p>
      <p>
        The SAC union was ordered to pay <strong>139,000 SEK</strong> in legal
        fees, to reimburse the opposing party’s litigation and attorney costs.
      </p>

      <p>
        On <strong>26 November</strong>, <strong>Realtid</strong> reported that
        <strong>Skatteverket</strong> had frozen <strong>Izakaya Koi</strong>’s
        bank accounts and revoked its alcohol license due to massive bookkeeping
        fraud. Estimated tax debt reached <strong>905,780 SEK</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        On 26 November, Izakayakoi Aktiebolag received a payment of
        <strong>6.8 million SEK</strong> recorded as an asset transfer. Later
        that same day, <strong>approx. 1.9 million SEK</strong> were transferred
        out from the same account to its holding company, Isakaya AB.
      </p>

      <p>
        On <strong>9 December</strong>,
        <strong>Izakayakoi Aktiebolag</strong> became
        <strong>Chip-Chop mat AB</strong>. That same day, a new entity,
        <strong>Izakayakoi AB </strong> (org. no. 556765-3844), was registered
        at <strong>c/o Restaurang Steakhouse Lilla Torg</strong>, linked to the
        Chudasama family.
      </p>

      <p>
        The company’s board included both
        <strong>Jayantilal Chudasama</strong> (age ~63) as Chairman and his son
        <strong>Alexander Saahil Chudasama</strong> as Director, confirming
        direct father–son involvement.
      </p>

      <p>
        Around <strong>17 December</strong>, <strong>Izakayakoi AB</strong> was
        granted a new serving license, shortly after being restructured under a
        different legal entity with new representatives.
      </p>

      <p>
        On <strong>19 December</strong>, media reports revealed that
        Skatteverket had uncovered unreported earnings linked to
        <strong>Izakayakoi AB</strong>, used to finance personal luxury
        expenses, including high-end shopping in London and New York.
      </p>

      <p>
        The owner was reported to have spent
        <strong>1.1 million SEK</strong> from undeclared income between 2006 and
        2008. Skatteverket considered these funds to be disguised salary income
        not declared or taxed correctly.

        On <strong>9 May</strong>, former Izakayakoi owner

        crimes, following a deep audit by <strong>Skatteverket</strong>
        targeting cash register manipulation and undeclared revenues.
      </p>

      <p>
        Prosecutors stated that the alleged offenses could result in up to six

        <summary><strong>Holding Company</strong></summary>
        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
          A <strong>Holding Company</strong> is an entity created to own shares
          in one or more other companies, usually without direct commercial
          operations of its own. Its purpose is to control, consolidate, or
          protect underlying business assets.
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
          In large corporate groups, a holding might coordinate finance, legal
          strategy, and investment flows across subsidiaries.
          <u>In smaller setups or offshore structures</u>, however, holdings may
          serve more symbolic or strategic purposes — such as
          <span style="background-color: #e5e7eb"
            >isolating liabilities, fragmenting control, or hiding the true
            beneficial owner</span
          >.
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
          The term “holding” does not guarantee operational depth.
          <strong>In your case, MedFood Holdings Ltd</strong> is registered in
          Cyprus, has no known employees or infrastructure, and serves
          exclusively as the legal owner of IzakayaKoi AB post-2004. This is a
          <u>classic example of a passive holding vehicle</u> — potentially
          designed for tax or opacity purposes.
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
          A holding may appear legitimate in public records, yet be disconnected
          from the daily operations, which remain handled by nominees or
          external managers. That’s why
          <span style="background-color: #e5e7eb"
            >the title “holding” must always be cross-examined</span
          >
          with actual business substance.
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
          In forensic work, holdings act as anchors: they centralize formal
          control but may not reflect the real ecosystem of people, payments,
          and power.
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
          <strong>In corporate genealogy, holdings are structural pivots</strong
          >: they signal transitions, ownership shifts, or hidden
          consolidations. Identifying their connections helps reconstruct
          ownership trees and expose coordination across legal entities.

        <summary><strong>Legal Notice</strong></summary>
        <p>
          A <strong>legal notice</strong> (or <em>mentions légales</em> in
          French) refers to the mandatory publication of identifying details
          about the entity behind a website, such as the publisher, address, VAT
          number, or legal operator.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Sweden, this is enforced under the
          <strong>E-commerce Act (2002:562)</strong> and ensures transparency,
          consumer protection, and traceability.
        </p>
        <p>
          Non-compliance can hinder legal recourse in disputes or complaints.

        <summary><strong>Corporate Genealogy</strong></summary>
        <p style="line-height: 1.5">
          <strong>Corporate Genealogy</strong> is a method used to trace the <em>ancestry and evolution of a business</em> — not just its current ownership, but its historical relationships, transitions, and patterns of influence.
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.5">
          It examines how companies <strong>split, merge, rename, relocate, or rebrand</strong>, and how founders, family members, or key advisors continue to shape operations across decades, even without formal control.
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.5">
          Unlike traditional ownership tracing (focused on shares), corporate genealogy includes:
          <ul>
            <li>Shared addresses and staff over time</li>
            <li>Repeated use of certain lawyers, auditors, or advisors</li>
            <li>Legacy business models that reappear under new brands</li>
            <li>Succession of influence: who mentored or empowered whom</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.5">
          Corporate genealogy is particularly useful when:
          <ul>
            <li>Founders use multiple companies to test or launch variations</li>
            <li>Family control is passed on informally</li>
            <li>New entities are created to sidestep reputation or financial baggage</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.5">
          It draws from <strong>archival research</strong>, <strong>forensic analysis</strong>, and <strong>pattern recognition</strong>. It's often used by investigative journalists, compliance lawyers, or private intelligence analysts to uncover long-term continuity disguised by legal fragmentation.
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.5">
          📌 It helps answer: “Where did this concept really come from?” or “Why does this structure look familiar?” — and allows us to understand <strong>why some actors never appear on paper, yet their influence is unmistakable.</strong>

        <summary><strong>Forensic History</strong></summary>
        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
          <strong>Forensic History</strong> is the structured reconstruction of
          past events, decisions, and connections in order to understand how a
          situation unfolded — especially in the context of conflict, risk, or
          hidden agendas.
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
          Unlike classic historical narrative, forensic history focuses on
          <strong
            >intentional omissions, grey zones, and invisible
            relationships</strong
          >. It aims to reassemble what was disaggregated — legally,
          structurally, or rhetorically.
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
          It is particularly useful when
          <span style="background-color: #e5e7eb"
            >official documents appear clean</span
          >
          but a deeper logic of obfuscation or control is suspected. It
          mobilizes documents, registries, press archives, leaks, and timeline
          inconsistencies to create a coherent map.
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
          In your use case, forensic history helps determine
          <u>when real ownership diverged from legal representation</u>, and
          whether events (e.g. liquidation, resignations, trust formations) are
          symptoms of deeper coordination.
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
          Forensic history is used by investigative journalists, judicial
          commissions, corporate analysts, and researchers dealing with opaque
          ecosystems. It often reveals
          <strong>the intentional engineering of forgetting</strong>.
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
          It does not prove fraud directly — but it builds a high-resolution
          narrative capable of exposing contradictions that justify deeper
          scrutiny.

      <details id="four-corners-rule">
        <summary><strong>Four Corners Rule</strong></summary>
        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
          The <strong>Four Corners Rule</strong> is a legal principle stating
          that a document must be interpreted solely based on what is written
          “within its four corners” — meaning the four sides of the paper. No
          external evidence may be introduced to modify or explain the text
          unless the document is ambiguous.
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
          Originating in <strong>Anglo-American contract law</strong>, the
          doctrine is used in courts to determine the intent of a contract or
          agreement, by restricting analysis to its internal content.
          <u
            >Everything needed for interpretation must be found in the document
            itself</u
          >.
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
          In forensic work, this principle becomes relevant when documents (like
          shareholder agreements, minutes, audits) are drafted to appear
          self-contained and unambiguous — even when their real function may be
          to disguise a transfer, an omission, or a hidden beneficiary.
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
          <span style="background-color: #e5e7eb"
            >The Four Corners Rule is useful to expose what is intentionally
            omitted</span
          >. When a document is silent on a topic that would logically be
          mentioned, the absence itself can become a clue — especially when
          compared across versions or years.
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
          In your case, the principle helps evaluate whether documents (e.g.
          annual reports, resolutions, agreements) are “complete” or were
          drafted to
          <strong
            >appear formally correct while omitting material relationships or
            changes of control</strong
          >.
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
          It is not a forensic tool in itself — but it sets the ground for
          spotting legal engineering or documentary stagecraft, especially when
          paired with timeline analysis and external evidence.

        <summary><strong>Principle of the 4 Coherences</strong></summary>
        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
          This method tests the plausibility of a structural or operational link
          between two entities by evaluating consistency across four forensic
          axes:
        </p>
        <ul style="line-height: 1.4">
          <li>
            <strong>Temporal Coherence</strong>: Do major events (e.g. share
            transfers, liquidations, restructurings) occur in synchrony or
            sequence?
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Geographic Coherence</strong>: Do both companies operate
            from the same physical or legal address? Any overlap in site usage
            or postal registrations?
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Financial Coherence</strong>: Are there interlinked cash
            flows (e.g. rent, loans, management fees)? Do declared profits and
            losses evolve in tandem or offset each other?
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Decision-Making Coherence</strong>: Do the same individuals
            appear in both boards, signatures, or meeting minutes?
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
          A strong match across all four dimensions can justify a hypothesis of
          concealed continuity, de facto control, or orchestrated restructuring
          — even without a formal merger or holding structure.

      <details id="theoriesA">
        <summary><strong>Theory A – Risk-Sharing Structure</strong></summary>
        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
          This hypothesis assumes that multiple companies are maintained in
          parallel in order to distribute tax exposure or legal liability. One
          company (e.g. IzakayaKoi) takes on aggressive practices (undeclared
          cash, off-book transactions), while another (e.g. Steakhouse AB)
          remains “clean” and operational.
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
          The goal is to let one entity absorb the risk — tax audits, sanctions,
          or permanent revocation — while keeping another entity
          <strong
            >shielded from scrutiny and ready to continue operations</strong
          >.
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
          This structure is most effective when
          <span style="background-color: #e5e7eb"
            >the clean company is superficially unconnected</span
          >
          but shares key characteristics: location, people, suppliers, and cash
          patterns.
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
          It often appears as a legal relay, where one entity “falls” while
          another quietly takes over without interruption.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details id="theoriesB">
        <summary><strong>Theory B – Asset Stripping Strategy</strong></summary>
        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
          This theory posits that one company is progressively emptied of its
          valuable assets (equipment, personnel, clientele, brand, cash) in
          favor of another — typically a newer, safer, or less exposed entity.
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
          The original entity (e.g. IzakayaKoi AB) appears to decline in
          performance, while the receiving entity (e.g. Steakhouse AB) suddenly
          improves, often without a formal transfer or acquisition.
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
          Red flags include: <strong>underpriced asset sales</strong>,
          <span style="background-color: #e5e7eb"
            >overlapping employees or leases</span
          >, and strategic underreporting of profits in the stripped entity.
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
          The intent is to allow one company to "die" formally while another
          captures the value — often in anticipation of bankruptcy, audit, or
          tax exposure.

      <details id="board-member">
        <summary><strong>Board Member</strong></summary>
        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
          A <strong>Board Member</strong> is a legally registered director
          responsible for overseeing and formally representing the company’s
          interests. In most jurisdictions, this position grants voting power on
          key governance issues such as financial reporting, strategic
          decisions, and executive appointments.
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
          Board Members are usually appointed by shareholders. In larger
          companies, they are selected for their experience or expertise and may
          sit as part of a multi-member board with clear role distributions
          (Chairperson, Treasurer, etc.).
          <strong
            >In smaller companies, the board may consist of a single
            individual</strong
          >
          — often the founder or a family member — making the board structure a
          legal formality rather than a functioning body.
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
          <strong>The presence of only one board member</strong> (especially
          when coupled with a <em>Deputy Board Member</em> but no wider
          governance team) often reflects a tightly held company,
          <strong>possibly a shell entity</strong>, or a low-activity business.
          In forensic terms, this may suggest risk exposure due to limited
          oversight or consolidated control.
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
          Board members have <strong>personal legal liability</strong> in cases
          of fraudulent reporting, tax evasion, or corporate negligence. Their
          names are typically listed in national company registries and can be
          tracked across multiple entities to detect patterns of control,
          influence, or recurring irregularities.
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
          The board structure serves
          <strong>both functional and symbolic</strong> purposes. In robust
          firms, it supports governance and transparency. In minimal structures,
          it may serve only to meet registration requirements while
          <strong>shielding decision-makers behind formal titles</strong>.

        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
          <strong>This position is typically symbolic</strong> and rarely
          activated in practice. In many cases, deputy members are friends,
          family members, or legal acquaintances of the main director — not
          selected for oversight capacity but simply to satisfy registry
          conditions.

          A <strong>Holding Company</strong> is a legal entity created to own
          shares in one or more other companies. It typically does not produce

        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
          <u>In large corporate groups</u>, holding companies may centralize

          Holding companies are often used to group together several businesses

        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
          In forensic analysis, a holding company may act as an anchor — it
          holds the legal link to assets, but not necessarily the power to

          <summary><strong>Liability Mapping</strong></summary>
          <p style="line-height: 1.5">
            <strong>Liability Mapping</strong> is the forensic analysis of <em>who is legally, financially, or reputationally responsible</em> for decisions made within a corporate structure — especially when ownership, operations, and communication are spread across multiple legal entities.
          </p>
          <p style="line-height: 1.5">
            It is commonly used when <strong>the formal governance structure does not match the actual flow of authority or risk</strong>. In such cases, liability may not rest with the nominal board or shareholder, but with a hidden actor who drives operations, hires staff, or approves spending.
          </p>
          <p style="line-height: 1.5">
            Liability mapping seeks to answer questions like:
            <ul>
              <li>Who can be held accountable if something goes wrong?</li>
              <li>Which entity is exposed to legal claims, and who signed the contracts?</li>
              <li>Can risk be “dispersed” through proxies, layers, or dormant companies?</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p style="line-height: 1.5">
            This mapping is crucial in:
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Hybrid operations</strong> (where employees work across entities)</li>
              <li><strong>Multi-tenant locations</strong> (like restaurants operating inside hotels)</li>
              <li><strong>Family businesses</strong> using layers to reduce visibility or isolate debt</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p style="line-height: 1.5">
            It complements tools like <a href="#power-method"><strong>PPOWER(E)</strong></a> by highlighting not just <em>who controls</em>, but <em>who would be held accountable in court or press</em>.
          </p>
          <p style="line-height: 1.5">
            ⚠️ In some cases, liability is purposely obfuscated through nominee directors, offshore intermediaries, or asset-free operating shells. <strong>Liability Mapping is the discipline that seeks to pierce this veil.</strong>

            <summary><strong>Shadow Governance</strong></summary>
            <p style="line-height: 1.5">
              <strong>Shadow Governance</strong> refers to a structure of informal or hidden control within a company or organization, where real decisions are made by individuals <em>who are not officially listed</em> as board members, shareholders, or legal signatories.
            </p>
            <p style="line-height: 1.5">
              These actors may exert power through personal ties (family, spouses, long-time collaborators), financial leverage, or influence over day-to-day operations — without leaving a legal trace in public records. They can shape budgets, hiring, strategy, or even ownership changes from the shadows.
            </p>
            <p style="line-height: 1.5">
              Shadow governance is often used to:
              <ul>
                <li>Maintain control without legal responsibility or visibility</li>
                <li>Protect founders from liability or reputational risk</li>
                <li>Divide real power among informal groups (e.g., family councils, trusted proxies)</li>
                <li>Create plausible deniability in the event of legal scrutiny</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <p style="line-height: 1.5">
              In practice, shadow governance is common in:
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Family businesses</strong> (where elders or relatives informally direct decisions)</li>
                <li><strong>Founder-run groups</strong> with nominal boards or straw directors</li>
                <li><strong>International or offshore structures</strong> where power is transferred via mandate, trust, or front companies</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <p style="line-height: 1.5">
              Forensic analysts often detect shadow governance through indirect signals:
              <ul>
                <li>Repeated presence of the same individuals across unrelated companies</li>
                <li>Discrepancy between operational authority and legal registration</li>
                <li>Changes made “off the books” or without documented board consent</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <p style="line-height: 1.5">
              📌 Shadow governance does not always imply wrongdoing — it can be the result of tradition, trust, or pragmatism. But in risk analysis, it represents a critical blind spot: <strong>where control is real, but responsibility is hidden</strong>.

      <!--
  <section class="narrative-intro">
  
        <p>
          This part completes the <em>narrative grid</em> — by focusing on how
          authority was distributed, claimed, or blurred throughout the
          workplace conflict.
        </p>
        <details>
          <summary class="section-order">
            🕸️ <strong>Part 3 — Authority Mapping</strong>
          </summary>

          <p>
            <strong>Function:</strong> To trace how decisions were made,
            delegated, or avoided — and how visible and invisible roles shaped
            the workplace structure.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Fields:</strong> This method appears in
            <a href="/glossary.html#authority-mapping">authority mapping</a>
            (audit),
            <a href="/glossary.html#governance-review">governance reviews</a>,
            and

            management and legal investigations.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Usage:</strong> These tools are used to detect
            <strong>proxy authority</strong>,
            <strong>responsibility gaps</strong>, and
            <strong>unspoken hierarchies</strong> — especially where formal
            titles mask operational control.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Adaptation:</strong> This section identifies
            <strong>social roles</strong>, <strong>silences</strong>,
            <strong>disconnections</strong>, and <strong>improvisation</strong>.
            It exposes how instructions circulated without structure, and how
            power was enacted informally.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Structure:</strong> The narrative isolates key moments of
            implied authority. It focuses on contrasts — between who was legally
            in charge, and who shaped the team’s behavior in practice.

        <h2>Founder Figure</h2>
        <p>
          My father (<u>77</u>) was <strong>self-employed</strong>, an
          <strong>entrepreneur without leverage</strong>, driving his own
          concrete truck — at one point, two — and briefly hiring a second
          driver. He worked <strong>relentlessly</strong>, chasing
          <strong>social status</strong> as a <u>protective halo</u>. And with
          the pressure to return as a <u>successful immigrant</u>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our task was to <strong>tackle every critical problem</strong> in our
          way , so everything could run by Monday.
          <u>Silence replaced parenting</u>; he worked
          <strong>methodically, analytically</strong>, unfolding each solution
          <strong>in sequence</strong>. Even at meals, it was clear he was
          <u>mapping execution plans in his head</u>.
        </p>

        <p>
          I lived <strong>systemic alienation by proxy</strong>, as the job
          turned my father into a <strong>high-functioning automaton</strong>. I
          had no childhood — only proximity to <u>relentless duty</u>.
          <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0">At 16, I walked away</mark>.
          <em> — rejecting ambition</em>, seeking
          <strong>personal integrity</strong>. I never really looked back.

        <h2>Entrepreneur Prototype</h2>

        <p>
          I met <strong>my best and only friend</strong> during my final year of
          high school. <strong>Samuel</strong> (46) came from a
          <u>bourgeois Jewish family</u>, and in his field, men like him were
          called <strong>“lenders”</strong> — shorthand for credit-leasing. He
          showed up with cash when liquidity was tight. His car was his office.
        </p>

        <p>
          He spoke constantly about <strong>balance sheets</strong>,
          <strong>client types</strong>, and what made a “perfect financial.”
          His deals targeted firms with pristine numbers — he knew how to read
          them. I listened out of loyalty, never envy; the whole thing felt
          <span class="highlight">morally grey, borderline crooked</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          At <span class="highlight">35</span>, he launched his own firm — same
          model as the financing outfit where he trained, a kind of private
          lender. One of his former bosses would later go to prison. For five
          years, it thrived — then came
          <strong>seminars, alcohol, cocaine, burnout, lawsuits</strong>. I’d
          already walked away.

        <h2>Restaurateur Archetype</h2>
        <p>
          In <u>late 2023</u>, I joined the
          <a href="https://dapeppedue.se/" class="subtle-link">pizzeria</a> run
          by
          <a
            href="https://www.allabolag.se/befattning/muzaffer-korkmaz/-/10557570"
            class="subtle-link"
            >“Mussé”</a
          >
          (65), a Stockholm-based restaurateur with six companies and full
          ownership of two restaurants, including a
          <a href="https://ramblastapas.se" class="subtle-link">tapas bar</a>
          downtown. He was on-site two-thirds of the time — either in his office
          or directly on the floor.
        </p>

        <p>
          What stood out was his role as
          <strong>on-site problem solver</strong>. He varnished tables, fixed
          plumbing, and repaired everything from the dishwasher to the fridge.
          He’d ask if I needed help — and a few times
          <u>took over the station himself</u>. He subbed in as waiter, or
          pizzaïolo — no ego, no distance.
        </p>

        <p>
          Even as a <u>dishwasher</u>, the lowest-ranked job, I could call him
          and he’d show up — no delay. He never asked who gave the order. Anyone
          — cook, runner, waiter — could point, and he’d act. In the kitchen,
          <strong>he moved like staff, not like a boss</strong> — always alert
          to the smallest breakdown.

        <h2>Cofounding Teams</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>At 38</strong>, after years of backpacking and drifting
          between underpaid tech jobs, I returned to <u>Paris</u> and discovered
          the startup world. For the first time, a professional path
          <span class="highlight">felt both honest and exciting</span>: a way
          out of inherited pressure, without scams or self-sacrifice.
        </p>

        <p>
          The ecosystem promised <strong>high output, then escape</strong> — not
          a lifelong sentence. I could work like an athlete for 3 to 5 years,
          then <u>exit the system with dignity</u>. That fantasy matched both my
          tech past and my deeper need for
          <span class="highlight">freedom without deceit</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          I quickly framed the whole thing like an acquirer would.
          <strong>Execution and team</strong> were the only real levers. I
          wanted to be the <strong>technical cofounder</strong> — not a
          spokesperson, not a figurehead. What mattered was to
          <u>ship real features fast</u> and <u>pick the right partner</u>.
          Everything else was noise.

            <mark style="background-color: #ccc"
              >heat pumps and solar panels</mark
            >, financed through a mix of <u>green public subsidies</u> and
            <u>consumer loans</u> generating indirect revenue streams.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong> Structure & Roles:</strong> I was to become
            <u>president of the SAS</u>. Maggie would act as a commercial agent.
            I would manage operations, legal responsibilities, and business
            development, while Samuel remained off the radar, for legal and
            personal reasons.
          </p>

          <p></p>
          <p>
            🚩 <strong>Red Flags: </strong> Samuel was never able to articulate
            a <strong>clear value proposition</strong>, despite repeated
            requests. <u>No defined product</u>, <u>no target audience</u>,
            <mark style="background-color: #ccc">no market logic</mark>—just
            vague talk of network and financial upside.
          </p>

          <p>
            Meggie never <strong>introduced herself</strong> or made any effort
            to engage.
            <u>Her focus was split between children and personal calls</u>, even
            during key discussions. The project was only mentioned in
            <mark style="background-color: #ccc"
              >festive or distracted settings</mark
            >, never directly or with intention.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong> 💰 Financial Mechanics:</strong> Each loan issued to
            clients likely triggered <u>commissions from the bank</u>, in
            addition to state-backed installation incentives. The company relied
            on a <u>network of business brokers and subcontractors</u> to
            circulate deals and extract liquidity.

            >
            describes exactly this setup: a legal façade used to collect
            subsidies and circulate funds with no operational basis.
          </p>

          <p>
            The company functioned as a
            <a
              href="https://www.village-justice.com/articles/critere-classification-des,16989.html"

              ><strong>affectio societatis</strong></a
            >
            was entirely absent. In practice, it functioned more as a formal
            shell than a genuine collaborative venture.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Break Point:</strong> I realized within days there was
            <mark style="background-color: #ccc"
              >no project, no structure, no trust</mark
            >. Everything was driven by inertia and opacity. I declined to take
            the presidency and left before signing anything official.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Aftermath:</strong> The company was
            <u>officially liquidated in 2022</u>. Both founders have since
            <mark style="background-color: #ccc"
              >removed their LinkedIn presence</mark
            >. No trace remains in professional directories or networks.

          <p>
            <strong>Value Proposition:</strong> My partner at the time, a single
            mother on severance pay, asked to join a consumer review web app I
            was prototyping.
          </p>
          <p>
            We rented a shared office and started strong. But her availability,
            emotional bandwidth, and communication style weren’t compatible with
            the demands of a startup. We hit friction. She shut down. The
            project ended.
          </p>

          <strong>Lesson:</strong>
          Founders must resolve ambiguity. Energy and enthusiasm aren't enough.
          Alignment, honesty, and clarity are non-negotiable.

        </div>
        <h2>Co-founder ambiguity and early red flags</h2>
        <p>
          When I joined the team, no one introduced themselves as
          <strong>the founder</strong>. Henrik acted as the owner, but
          <u>Sahar</u> was the sole visible authority. I kept asking myself:
          <span class="highlight">who’s actually in charge?</span> No title, no
          presence, no clear anchor.
        </p>
        <p>
          At first, I assumed she was just another manager. But she answered
          questions Henrik avoided. She was sharp, brief, and firm. No warmth.
          No background story. She appeared out of nowhere, but
          <strong>nothing moved without her</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Over the years, I’d worked in
          <strong>44 companies across 6 countries</strong> — always in the
          shadows, always under pressure. Kitchens, warehouses, call centers,
          software teams. I’d seen every management flavor — tough, chaotic,
          absent, cynical.
        </p>
        <p>
          But <span class="highlight">never hostile, never immature</span>. What
          I saw at Quan, through Sahar, had no precedent. The coldness wasn’t
          cultural — it felt calculated. And it showed up instantly, without
          background, without buildup.
        </p>

        <h2>Patterns I’ve seen before</h2>
        <p>
          I’d been through
          <strong>three failed co-founder stories</strong> before joining QUAN.
          Each time, the breakdown came from the same ingredients:
          <u>blurred ownership</u>, <u>mismatched presence</u>, and
          <u>unspoken hierarchy</u>.
        </p>
        <p>
          One founder has the energy, the other holds the veto. One builds trust
          with the team, the other stays silent but controls the money. These
          setups <span class="highlight">always implode</span>.
        </p>

        <h2>The founder vacuum at QUAN</h2>
        <p>
          Henrik was there every day — visible, engaged, occasionally playful.
          But every critical call — contracts, suppliers, layout — was filtered
          through Sahar. Staff saw her rarely, but feared her judgement. She
          <strong>hovered</strong> over the structure, undefined but decisive.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even as I built trust with the kitchen crew, I sensed the real power
          didn’t sit in the restaurant. It sat somewhere <u>adjacent</u>,
          unnamed. The entire hierarchy floated on ambiguity.
        </p>

        <h2>Why this matters</h2>
        <p>
          In every startup, <strong>founder alignment isn’t optional</strong>.
          It’s oxygen. When one co-founder avoids exposure, while the other
          plays the frontman, the team gets confused. Loyalty dilutes. Authority
          becomes performative.
        </p>
        <p>
          It’s not a branding problem — it’s an
          <strong>operational fragility</strong>. And eventually, someone pays
          the price.
        </p>

          These three experiences shaped my understanding of what it means to
          build something with someone.

      <p>
        The ambiguity in responsibility at the heart of Quan’s management —
        marked by <strong>avoidance</strong>, <strong>blurred roles</strong>,
        and a <strong>lack of steady accountability</strong> — struck me the
        most. It naturally led to an archaeology of how this scaffolding was
        laid.
      </p>

      <p>
        When I first considered applying at Quan, I conducted a standard
        ownership check to tailor my motivation email.
        <strong
          >Henrik Kei Siebert was the only visible public figure linked to the
          restaurant</strong
        >, repeatedly cited in hotel communications and online articles as its
        founder.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong
          >No trace of a distinct legal entity operating Quan appeared in public
          records</strong
        >, which left me uncertain about whom to address—and forced me to send a
        generic, unpersonalized message.
      </p>

      <p>
        My job interview had been conducted by a woman who introduced herself as
        <strong>Sahar</strong>—"like Sahara", she said. Only later, by
        cross-checking the name in Personalkollen, did I understand she held a
        formal role within <strong>HSSC Event AB</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Despite this, <strong>Henrik Kei Siebert</strong>—the only visible
        public figure associated with Quan—did not appear anywhere in official
        records. His absence from the company’s registration was surprising,
        given his public role and occasional presence on site.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>According to the Swedish Beneficial Ownership Register</strong>,
        HSSC Event AB is controlled by KEHDA Holding AB, through which Lin
        Daniella Dahl holds between 50–75% of the shares. Her name is absent
        from operational documents and restaurant-facing materials.
      </p>

      <p>
        The domain <strong>quanbyquan.se</strong>, which has hosted Quan’s
        website since 2018, was registered on <strong>24 August 2018</strong>.
        WHOIS data discloses no owner identity, and the site contains no
        <em>impressum</em> or corporate details.
      </p>

      <p>
        Throughout my three weeks of employment at Quan,
        <strong>Saahil Chudasama</strong>—officially listed as a co-owner—was
        <strong>never seen on-site</strong>. No colleague ever mentioned him,
        and his name played no role in daily operations.
      </p>

      (2018–2024) confirm none of these elements ever appeared on the site.

      <p>
        Henrik’s role appeared
        <strong>detached from the daily team flow</strong>. I never witnessed
        him share a joke, give a directive, or interact casually with staff.
        From my position in the back kitchen, he always seemed removed, even
        when physically present.
      </p>
      <p>
        By contrast,
        <strong>Sahar was visibly active in team coordination</strong>. I saw
        her engage directly with the floor manager, the head chef, and multiple
        sous-chefs—often inside the kitchen. She also managed interviews and
        subcontractor issues. There was no doubt she operated at the core of
        daily operations.

          📌 Structural Note: Informal Leadership, Formal Incorporation
        </summary>
        <br />

        No internal communication or shared leadership structure was visible
        during the <strong>observed period</strong>. Staff routines followed
        <strong>practical rather than hierarchical logic</strong>, with no
        direct managerial access linked to the
        <strong>two registered owners</strong>.<br /><br />

        This model coexisted with
        <strong>remarkable financial output</strong>—reportedly over 5 million
        SEK in net profit in 2023, and
        <strong>3 weeks of advance booking</strong> at all times. The later
        registration of <em>Tributum AB</em> may indicate a step toward
        structural consolidation or <em>structural clarity</em>.
      </details>

      <p>
        Tributum AB officially declared a business activity of
        <strong>restaurant operations (restaurangverksamhet)</strong>. Its board
        includes <strong>Henrik Kei Siebert</strong> as CEO,
        <strong>Sahar El Nasser</strong> as board member, and
        <strong>Lin Daniella Dahl</strong> as deputy. This configuration mirrors
        operational roles already observed at Quan.
      </p>

      <p>
        This synchronised registration raises strategic questions. While
        <em>Tributum AB</em> was presented as a formal clarification of
        restaurant activity, <em>Aspiratio</em> could serve as a
        <em>holding or fallback structure</em>, or as a shielded platform
        disconnected from declared payroll operations.

          📌 Structural Insight: Dual Entities, Silent Repositioning
        </summary>

        <p>
          The mirrored setup of <strong>Tributum AB</strong> and
          <strong>Aspiratio Holding AB</strong>, both created on July 1st at the
          same address, goes beyond <strong>administrative convenience</strong>.
          Their design suggests an attempt to
          <strong>redistribute roles</strong>,
          <strong>separate exposures</strong>, and
          <strong>clarify legal responsibility</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          While Tributum declared active restaurant operations,
          <strong>Aspiratio remains structurally dormant</strong>: no payroll,
          no declared business. This silent setup may offer
          <strong>future flexibility</strong>,
          <strong>discreet compensation flows</strong>, or
          <strong>risk management</strong> beyond the main operation.
        </p>
        <p>
          This dual setup could act as a <strong>buffer</strong>—absorbing
          pressure, shielding liability, or preparing for change—without public
          disclosure or fiscal trace.
        </p>

        <p>
          Despite being officially registered only as a
          <em>suppleant</em> (alternate board member), her signature confirms an
          <strong>operational role in human resources</strong>. It also implies
          her position as the primary interface with
          <strong>external entities such as HRAK</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Separately, the <strong>employment certificate</strong> issued in my
          name was <strong>signed by Sahar El Nasser</strong>. This formal act
          establishes her involvement in administrative and personnel matters,
          beyond her nominal board position.

      <h1>Reading Help</h1>

      <p>
        This section is designed to help readers understand the structure and logic behind the AfterShift archive.
        It is not a blog in the conventional sense — it is a layered civic testimony built with legal and editorial intention.
      </p>

      <h2>🧭 What this archive contains</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Chronological posts</strong> documenting events and grievances as they unfolded</li>
        <li><strong>Fact-based reconstructions</strong> of employment abuse, contract denial, wage theft</li>
        <li><strong>Structural analyses</strong> of corporate opacity and hidden employer responsibility</li>
        <li><strong>Legal framing tools</strong> such as glossary, FAQ, or timeline</li>
        <li><strong>Public evidence</strong> (e.g. payslips, certificates, email captures)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>📚 How to navigate</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Start with <a href="/context.html">Personal Context</a> and <a href="/claim.html">Editorial Framework</a></li>
        <li>Use the <a href="/timeline.html">Timeline</a> for event-based navigation</li>
        <li>Consult the <a href="/glossary.html">Glossary</a> if legal or technical terms are unclear</li>

        <li>Visit <a href="/notes.html">Notes</a> for deep dives into corporate or procedural anomalies</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>🧠 What to keep in mind</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>This is a real situation, involving real legal and financial damage</li>
        <li>The tone is factual, deliberate, and non-emotional — even when the content is serious</li>
        <li>The site is <strong>not intended as a diary</strong> but as a reference dossier for legal, journalistic, or civic use</li>
        <li>Each post is linked to one or more verifiable documents</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>💬 Questions or clarifications?</h2>
      <p>

      <p>
        This blog is currently in its early development stage. While not
        intended for full-scale content publication yet, it serves as a
        structural prototype to define the foundations of a more comprehensive
        and SEO-oriented platform. Only minimal publication activity is planned
        during this phase. Updates focus on setting up the framework,
        structuring content, and ensuring traceability through a documented log.
        This documentation approach aligns with key principles of transparency,
        traceability, and good faith. Those interested in understanding the
        broader context are invited to explore the rationale behind this log.

      <h1>Legal Notice &amp; Data Policy</h1>

      <h2>1. Site Publisher</h2>
      <p>
        Site owner: Patrice Kenmoé (individual)<br />
        Address: Hyllie Boulevard 34, 215 32 Malmö, Sweden<br />
        Email: <a href="mailto:patrice@aftershift.se">patrice@aftershift.se</a>
      </p>

      <h2>2. Hosting</h2>
      <p>
        Hosted by GitHub, Inc.<br />
        88 Colin P. Kelly Jr Street, San Francisco, CA 94107, USA
      </p>

      <h2>3. Purpose of the Blog</h2>
      <p>
        AfterShift is a personal blog documenting legal reflections and lived
        experience in the context of labor, legal inertia, and social structure.
        It is neither a company nor a journalistic entity. Its tone is personal,
        reflective, and evolving.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Legal Status</h2>
      <p>
        The blog is managed by an individual based in Sweden and follows Swedish
        legal jurisdiction. Any disputes shall be handled by the courts of
        Malmö.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Editorial Responsibility</h2>
      <p>
        The blog is authored by Patrice Kenmoé. All content is self-published.
        Names and details may be anonymized to ensure privacy and legal safety.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Disclaimer</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          This blog represents personal experience and analysis. It is not
          intended to target individuals or damage reputations. The aim is to
          document systemic issues and provide structured, respectful
          commentary. Content is subject to frequent updates as the platform
          evolves.
        </li>

        <li>
          In narrative sections of the blog, certain personal names may be
          altered to protect the identity of individuals. These changes are made
          in good faith and aim to balance narrative clarity with respect for
          privacy. Any resemblance to real persons, living or dead, outside of
          documented facts, is coincidental.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>7. Commenting &amp; Feedback</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          The AfterShift blog includes a comment system (currently planned via
          Giscus, a lightweight tool built on GitHub Discussions).
        </li>
        <li>
          Giscus requires a GitHub account to participate in discussions. This
          choice was made for fast deployment and is not intended to restrict
          participation.
        </li>
        <li>
          Users who cannot or do not wish to use GitHub may contact us via email
          or participate through other platforms (e.g., OB1 Circles).
        </li>
        <li>
          As the platform evolves, comments may migrate to alternative tools
          (e.g., Commento or embedded forms), provided privacy and legal
          compliance are maintained.
        </li>
        <li>
          All significant changes will be clearly communicated via updated terms
          or page footers.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>8. Intellectual Property</h2>
      <p>
        All texts, visuals, and documents are original creations and property of
        Patrice Kenmoé unless otherwise stated. No reproduction is permitted
        without written consent.
      </p>

      <h2>9. Privacy &amp; Data</h2>
      <p>
        No personal data is collected without consent. Matomo Analytics may be
        used in full compliance with GDPR regulations. No cookies or identifiers
        are used to track individuals.
      </p>

      <h2>10. Evolution &amp; Versioning</h2>
      <p>
        This blog is updated daily and may evolve significantly over time. Legal
        notices and key policy documents are versioned and may change regularly.
        Changes will be documented and dated.
      </p>

      <h2>11. Cross-site Relationship</h2>
      <p>
        AfterShift is independent but connected to OB1.se (a separate community
        platform). Both are maintained by the same author but serve different
        purposes. Legal responsibilities are clearly separated.
      </p>

      <h2>12. PDF Fingerprinting & Traceability</h2>
      <p>
        Each access-restricted document is uniquely fingerprinted prior to
        delivery. This process does not affect readability or file structure but
        embeds a non-visible identifier to help trace unauthorized
        redistribution.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fingerprinting serves both to discourage leaks and to identify the
        origin of any unauthorized reproduction, without storing personal
        information in the file.
      </p>

Narrative Grid</h1>

      <h2>Personal Context</h2>
      <section class="narrative-intro">
        <details open>
          <summary class="section-order">
            🧩 <strong>Part 1 — Narrative Structure of Fact</strong>
          </summary>

          <p>
            <strong>Function:</strong> This part opens the
            <em>narrative grid</em>, a three-part structure designed to document
            — rather than interpret — key stages of a workplace conflict. It
            lays out how, when, and under what intent I entered the situation.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Fields:</strong> This kind of structure appears as a
            <a href="/glossary.html#case-chronology">case chronology</a>
            (legal), a
            <a href="/glossary.html#mission-log">mission log</a> (ops), or an
            <a href="/glossary.html#incident-report">incident report</a> (HR).
            Comparable formats exist in investigative journalism, field
            diagnostics, and strategic consulting.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Usage:</strong> Lawyers, auditors, and compliance agents use
            such forms to detect
            <a href="/glossary.html#managerial-drift">managerial drift</a>,
            <a href="/glossary.html#accountability-gap">accountability gaps</a>,
            or signs of
            <a href="/glossary.html#proxy-communication">proxy communication</a>
            in hierarchical systems.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Adaptation:</strong> This structure is here deployed as a
            <em>preemptive layer</em> — not to persuade, but to resist. It
            anticipates legal tactics aiming to minimize damage by framing the
            claimant as incoherent, fragile, or unserious.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Structure:</strong> The narrative follows a strict
            3-paragraph model: intent, chronology, and strategic framing. It
            presents no claim and no emotion — only a foundation.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Function:</strong> To reconstruct how work actually unfolded
            — who gave instructions, who took charge, and how roles shifted
            beyond official titles or contracts.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Fields:</strong> Known as a

            (audit). All describe how systems operate below the surface.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Usage:</strong> Used by compliance officers, workplace
            mediators, and researchers to clarify informal routines, relational
            tensions, and decision patterns that don’t appear in formal
            hierarchies.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Adaptation:</strong> This section captures how fragmented
            authority and social silences shaped daily life. It tracks where
            guidance came from, who avoided responsibility, and how staff
            compensated through informal channels.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Structure:</strong> The narrative follows a chronological
            logic, grounded in first-person memory and interaction flow. It
            prioritizes lived routines over documentation.

          <p>
            <strong>Function:</strong> To trace how decisions were made,
            delegated, or avoided — and how visible and invisible roles shaped

            <strong>Usage:</strong> These tools are used to detect
            <strong>proxy authority</strong>,
            <strong>responsibility gaps</strong>, and
            <strong>unspoken hierarchies</strong> — especially where formal

          <p>
            <strong>Adaptation:</strong> This section identifies
            <strong>social roles</strong>, <strong>silences</strong>,
            <strong>disconnections</strong>, and <strong>improvisation</strong>.
            It exposes how instructions circulated without structure, and how
            power was enacted informally.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Structure:</strong> The narrative isolates key moments of
            implied authority. It focuses on contrasts — between who was legally
            in charge, and who shaped the team’s behavior in practice.

          This is the third entry in a triptych exploring the practical,
          interpersonal, and structural conditions of a workplace conflict. It

          This final part focuses on
          <strong
            >role expectations, managerial presence, and internal authority
            patterns</strong
          >
          — especially when formal contracts fail to reflect operational
          reality.
        </p>

        <p>
          In corporate sociology or organizational diagnostics, this type of
          narrative aligns with a <strong>role-mapping audit</strong> or a
          <strong>governance ambiguity assessment</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          It helps clarify not only <strong>who was meant to lead</strong>, but
          also <strong>who actually did</strong> — and where the gaps, silences,
          or reversals emerged.

          <strong>📌 Note — Auditor Appointment Requirement in Sweden</strong>
        </summary>

        <p style="line-height: 1.5">
          Under Swedish law (<em>Årsredovisningslagen</em>), limited companies
          must appoint a statutory auditor if they exceed
          <strong>2 out of 3 thresholds</strong> for
          <u>two consecutive years</u>:

          In the case of <strong>HSSC Event AB</strong>, the 2023 credit report

        <ul style="margin-bottom: 1em">
          <li><strong>2021</strong> → 11.3 MSEK turnover</li>

        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
          <strong>🧾 Conclusion</strong> — If the company had >3 employees and
          >3 MSEK in turnover as early as 2020 (likely given the curve), it
          triggered the legal obligation to appoint an auditor by
          <strong>2021</strong>.

          Its appointment on <strong>10 May 2021</strong> may reflect a
          <u>late compliance adjustment</u> — a common occurrence among
          fast-scaling private firms. Not a scandal, but a useful forensic
          marker.

        <summary><strong>📎 Note — Role of a Holding Company</strong></summary>
        <p style="line-height: 1.5">
          A <strong>holding company</strong> is a legal structure created to
          <u>own shares in one or more other companies</u>, often without any
          direct operational activity. Its primary purpose is to
          <u>consolidate control and centralize profits</u>, typically through
          the reception of dividends.
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.5">
          In Sweden, this structure is widely used for
          <strong>tax optimization</strong>: profits received by the holding are
          usually tax-exempt, and personal income from dividends can be deferred
          or distributed under more favorable tax brackets (typically

          This setup is <u>legal and common</u>, especially among entrepreneurs

        <summary><strong>📎 Note — Property & Asset Manager</strong></summary>

        <p style="line-height: 1.6">
          A <strong>property & asset manager</strong> is a type of company that
          doesn't sell anything or run a daily business. Instead, it's often
          used to
          <span style="background-color: #e5e7eb"
            ><strong>own things</strong> (like real estate or shares)</span
          >
          and <strong>get paid</strong> from them.
        </p>

        <p style="line-height: 1.6">
          For example, some restaurateurs use one company to run the restaurant,
          and
          <span style="background-color: #e5e7eb"
            ><strong>another company to own the building</strong></span
          >
          or receive rent. This setup can also help
          <u><strong>finance a personal apartment</strong></u> or protect family
          property.
        </p>

        <p style="line-height: 1.6">
          It's a <strong>common and legal structure</strong>, especially when
          people want to <u>separate risk and income</u>, or when they want to
          <u>pay themselves differently</u> — not as salary, but through other
          income.

        <summary><strong>📌 Note — What’s an “Invest AB”?</strong></summary>

        <p style="line-height: 1.6em">
          The <strong>“Invest AB”</strong> suffix — short for
          <em>Investment Aktiebolag</em> — doesn’t always imply an active
          investment firm. In Swedish business practice, it often means a
          company used for
          <strong>holding, shielding, or managing income</strong> through a
          separate legal structure.
        </p>

        <p style="line-height: 1.6em">
          The model is popular among restaurateurs and service professionals.
          Instead of drawing a salary (which is taxed at a higher rate), they
          channel earnings into their Invest AB, pay lower corporate tax, and
          later <u>withdraw dividends</u> at favorable rates.
        </p>

        <p style="line-height: 1.6em">
          In Malmö’s hospitality scene, dozens of “Invest AB” entities serve to
          <u>buy family apartments</u>, <u>own restaurant buildings</u>, or
          simply <u>shield liability</u>. It’s a quiet way of
          <span style="background-color: #e5e7eb"

        <p style="line-height: 1.6em">

          In Swedish company law, a
          <strong>board member</strong> (styrelseledamot) is the official legal

          often due to <u>reputation concerns</u>, past legal trouble, or the

        <p style="line-height: 1.6em">
          In many hospitality ventures,
          <strong>board members listed in legal filings</strong> are not the
          actual initiators or operators. Instead, they often act as
          <u>legal proxies</u> for visibility-sensitive founders, allowing for
          discretion, operational distancing, or reputational shielding.

          >, despite his public role in launching Quan, points to a likely
          strategy of <strong>protective distancing</strong>. This setup enables
          the true initiator to
          <u>control strategy and execution from the background</u>, while
          ensuring no formal tie appears in commercial registries.
        </p>

        <p style="line-height: 1.6em">
          In high-end properties—especially those operating under
          <strong>Marriott International</strong> or
          <strong>Elite Hotels of Sweden</strong>—such distancing may even be
          required. Large hotel groups often <u>conduct internal vetting</u> and
          avoid contracting with individuals involved in prior disputes,
          reputational risk, or internal conflicts. This can lead to private
          conditions requiring founders to remain out of legal view, using
          <span class="highlight">“clean” board members</span> as interface.
        </p>

        <p style="line-height: 1.6em">
          While not inherently illegal, this practice blurs the lines between
          <u>ownership, control, and liability</u>. It can be used to obscure
          lines of accountability and delay consequences in case of legal
          disputes, financial mismanagement, or employee claims.

        <p style="line-height: 1.6em">
          In Sweden, the 2015 EU directive on money laundering requires
          companies to register a
          <strong>verklig huvudman</strong> (beneficial owner), separate from
          the board, to limit such opacity. Yet in practice,

        <p style="line-height: 1.6em">
          <strong>Etagegruppen AB</strong> (org. 556402-6697) is a regional
          hospitality group founded on <strong>July 25, 1990</strong> by
          <strong>Michael Hagqvist</strong> (21), to operate the Malmö nightclub
          <strong>Etage</strong>, located at
          <span class="highlight">Stortorget 6</span>. The venue, originally
          opened in the 1980s, became one of the largest clubs in the city with
          <span class="highlight">4 dance floors and a karaoke bar</span>, and
          has remained an iconic nightlife spot.
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.6em">
          During the 2000s, Etagegruppen expanded its footprint in Malmö with a
          portfolio including:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Centiliter & Gram</strong> (created 2007, opened 2008) – a
            premium cocktail bar (Stortorget 17), popular among the 25+ crowd;
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Goose Bar & Restaurang</strong> (launched 2010) – a casual
            pub-restaurant near Gustav Adolfs Torg;
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Club operations at Hotel Scandic Crown</strong> – under the
            names <em>Level</em> (mainstream) and <em>Wonk</em> (LGBT+), active
            since 2011.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <!-- Avant la liste -->
        <p>
          By 2012, the group simultaneously managed
          <span class="highlight"
            >Etage, Centiliter & Gram, Goose, and Level/Wonk</span
          >, employing cross-venue synergies in marketing, ticketing, and HR.

          In <strong>April 2012</strong>, Etagegruppen acquired
          <strong>Izakaya Koi AB</strong> (556765-3844), absorbing its
          operational structure but preserving its original name and atmosphere.
        </p>

        <p>
          This marked the closure of the <em>Henrik Siebert era</em> and
          consolidated Etagegruppen’s control over key nightlife assets in
          Malmö’s central square.
        </p>

        <p style="line-height: 1.6em">
          Etagegruppen’s reputation remains solid in Malmö’s nightlife scene. In
          2013, its parent company posted revenues of
          <strong>~5.5 million SEK</strong> (excluding subsidiaries), and its
          venues are regularly featured in nightlife guides. Hagqvist has also
          acted as a semi-official spokesperson for local business owners,
          including public opposition to restrictive terrace regulations.

        <p style="line-height: 1.6em">
          In the context of a 4-star hotel like <u>Elite Hotel Esplanade</u>, a
          <strong>restaurant operated on-site</strong> should follow a
          transparent, minimal structure. Instead, the setup around
          <strong>Restaurant Steakhouse Lilla Torg AB</strong> involves at least
          <span class="highlight">five companies</span> — <u>Tributum AB</u>,
          <u>Aspiratio Holding AB</u>, <u>HSSC Event AB</u>,
          <u>Kedah Holding AB</u>, and <u>Chudasama Invest AB</u> — with
          overlapping control and unclear division of functions.
        </p>

        <ul style="line-height: 1.6em">
          <li>
            📄 <strong>Tributum AB</strong> was used for VAT registration and to
            employ restaurant staff.
          </li>
          <li>
            🏢 <strong>HSSC Event AB</strong> signed the commercial lease with
            the hotel, acting as legal tenant.
          </li>
          <li>
            🧾 <strong>Kedah Holding AB</strong> issued invoices to customers
            and processed payments, despite having no front-facing role.
          </li>
          <li>
            🔒 <strong>Chudasama Invest AB</strong> received dividends and
            declared capital movement without direct operational involvement.
          </li>
          <li>
            💼 <strong>Aspiratio Holding AB</strong> remains
            <span class="highlight">untraceable in ownership structure</span>,
            with no beneficial owners listed in the registry.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p style="line-height: 1.6em">
          A healthy and conventional structure in such a hospitality context
          would involve:
        </p>

        <ul style="line-height: 1.6em">
          <li>
            ✅ <strong>One single operational company</strong> handling all
            front-of-house and contractual responsibilities.
          </li>
          <li>
            ✅ Registered VAT and F-skatt directly under the same legal entity.
          </li>
          <li>
            ✅ Transparent board and <u>declared beneficial ownership</u>.
          </li>
          <li>
            ✅ Public declaration of
            <strong>profit distribution</strong> through standard Bolagsverket
            filings.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p style="line-height: 1.6em">
          Splitting leases, invoices, and payroll across multiple shell
          companies in the same space creates operational opacity,
          <strong>limits accountability</strong>, and can be seen as a tactic to
          <u>compartmentalize risk or obscure liability</u>. In a premium hotel
          environment, this raises red flags for unions, auditors, and brand
          partners.

            📎 Note – Strategic Salary Levels Among Restaurateurs in
            Sweden</strong
          >
        </summary>
        <p style="line-height: 1.6em">
          In Sweden, many restaurateurs and small business owners consistently
          report personal **net salaries between 30,000 and 45,000 SEK per
          month**. These figures appear across tax declarations, Bolagsverket
          reports, and UC credit data. This range is not accidental — it
          reflects a **calculated strategy** to balance
          <strong>fiscal efficiency</strong>,
          <strong>social legitimacy</strong>, and
          <strong>administrative simplicity</strong>.
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.6em">
          This income band is high enough to demonstrate financial stability and
          ensure access to services (like housing, loans, and visas), while
          remaining below thresholds that could trigger enhanced taxation or
          scrutiny.
        </p>
        <ul style="line-height: 1.6em">
          <li>
            <strong>🧾 Tax efficiency:</strong> staying below the
            <u>state tax threshold</u> of approx.
            <strong>613,900 SEK/year brutto</strong> (≈51,000 SEK/month) avoids
            an extra 20% income tax on top of the standard municipal tax
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>🏛 Administrative visibility:</strong> allows owners to show
            a clean, steady income for Försäkringskassan, Migrationsverket,
            Skatteverket, and banks
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>📉 Risk minimization:</strong> avoids suspicion or red flags
            associated with excessive declared income or undeclared gains
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>📦 Image management:</strong> aligns with public
            expectations of “working owner” rather than silent shareholder
            extracting dividends
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p style="line-height: 1.6em">
          In many cases, the **salary is not a reflection of actual profit**,
          but a strategic benchmark. A business owner might earn more through
          dividends, leasing benefits, or reinvested company funds, but declares
          a stable salary for optics and structure.
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.6em">
          Some patterns observed across restaurants and consultancies:
        </p>
        <ul style="line-height: 1.6em">
          <li>
            <strong>Daniela:</strong> ≈30,000 SEK net/month – stable and modest
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Henrik:</strong> 31,000 SEK net/month – just under state tax
            limit
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Sahar:</strong> ~41,000 SEK net/month – close to threshold,
            but possibly offset by deductions
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p style="line-height: 1.6em">
          These salaries offer an ideal balance: they are
          <strong>visible, plausible, and sustainable</strong>. They avoid
          scrutiny while preserving access to administrative benefits. In some
          cases, they may also help reduce the perceived need to explain or
          justify dividends.
        </p>
        <ul style="line-height: 1.6em">
          <li>
            <strong>✅ Avoids assumptions of under-declaration</strong> (too
            low)
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong
              >✅ Avoids suspicion of overpayment or artificial profit
              inflation</strong
            >
            (too high)
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>✅ Creates a "normal" middle-class profile</strong> without
            excessive exposure
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p style="line-height: 1.6em">
          This strategy is often part of a broader compensation plan where
          salary is just one element. Others include:
        </p>
        <ul style="line-height: 1.6em">
          <li>🚗 <u>Company car leasing</u></li>
          <li>📱 <u>Phone, laptop and subscription expenses</u></li>
          <li>💳 <u>Meals and perks via business cards</u></li>
          <li>
            💼 <u>Intermittent dividend payouts below visibility threshold</u>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p style="line-height: 1.6em">
          In doing so, the entrepreneur achieves three things at once: (1) a
          steady, credible income line; (2) reduced tax load; and (3) minimal
          personal exposure.
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.6em">
          In most cases, <strong>30k–45k SEK net/month</strong> appears to be a
          psychological and fiscal “sweet spot” — high enough to look
          legitimate, low enough to remain under the radar. This is especially
          relevant in **high-turnover, high-cash sectors** like restaurants,
          catering, and events.
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.6em">
          It also enables long-term administrative consistency: social security
          contributions, pension points, and sickness insurance are all linked
          to declared salary — not to dividends.
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.6em">
          <strong>📌 Summary:</strong> Restaurateurs often pick salary levels
          that are <strong>just below the national tax cliff</strong> while
          satisfying social and legal visibility requirements. This gives them
          legitimacy, flexibility, and protection — without inviting audits or
          raising questions.

        <p style="line-height: 1.6em">
          A <strong>shell company</strong> (or <em>“société écran”</em>) is a

          <span class="highlight"
            >no significant assets or active operations</span
          >. It exists mainly on paper and is often used to
          <strong><u>hold shares, obscure ownership</u></strong
          >, or structure financial flows.
        </p>

        <p style="line-height: 1.6em">
          Shell companies are commonly used to
          <span class="highlight">limit liability, avoid taxes</span>, or enable
          <u>offshore asset transfers</u>. While they can serve legitimate
          purposes (e.g., pre-launch entities, investment vehicles), they are
          frequently involved in
          <strong>opacity, cross-border layering</strong>, or

        </p>

        <p style="line-height: 1.6em">
          In legal and forensic contexts, the presence of a shell company often
          signals a need for

          was a <u>deep trench filled with water</u> built around a castle,
          acting as a physical defense system against invaders. Its purpose was
          to protect the stronghold by making access difficult and dangerous. 🏰
        </p>

        <p style="line-height: 1.6em">
          The term <strong>"moat"</strong> was later adopted in finance by
          <a href="https://www.morningstar.com/" class="subtle-link"
            >Morningstar</a
          >, which evaluates companies based on their
          <span class="highlight">long-term competitive advantages</span>. A
          “moat” refers to any structural edge — <u>brand</u>, <u>patents</u>,
          <u>cost leadership</u> — that protects profits over time.
        </p>

        <p style="line-height: 1.6em">
          A company rated as <strong>“No Moat”</strong> by Morningstar is seen
          as <span class="highlight">vulnerable to competitive erosion</span>.
          It lacks pricing power, customer lock-in, or meaningful scale
          advantage. Its business model is replicable, and its margins are
          easily threatened.
        </p>

        <p style="line-height: 1.6em">
          In the restaurant sector — especially in
          <span class="highlight">congested hubs like Lilla Torg</span> — the
          “no moat” label fits venues that rely on foot traffic or local
          familiarity, but <strong>have no economic defense mechanism</strong>.
        </p>

        <p style="line-height: 1.6em">

        <p style="line-height: 1.6em">
          🗣️ <strong>Term origin:</strong> <em>Affectio societatis</em> is a
          Latin legal phrase used in French corporate law. It literally means
          "<em>willingness to form a company</em>". It refers to the mutual
          intention of individuals to form and operate a business together as
          partners.

        <p style="line-height: 1.6em">
          ⚖️ In French jurisprudence, <strong>affectio societatis</strong> is a
          legal condition for the validity of a partnership or company. It
          proves that the founding members are not just nominal shareholders —
          but truly wish to cooperate and take joint risks.

          🗣️ <strong>Term origin:</strong> The expression

          describe a company that was not created to operate a real business —
          but to simulate legitimacy while enabling fraudulent activities.

        <summary><strong>📎 Note — Legal Fiction</strong></summary>

        <p>
          <strong>Definition:</strong> A <em>legal fiction</em> is a fact
          assumed or created by courts, legislatures, or institutions to apply a
          legal rule. It allows the law to treat something as true or existing
          even if it is not, strictly speaking, the case.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Origin:</strong> Latin expression <em>“fictio juris”</em> —
          widely used in Roman law and revived in modern legal theory. The
          French term <strong>fiction juridique</strong> translates precisely to
          <strong>legal fiction</strong> in English and to
          <strong>rättslig fiktion</strong> in Swedish.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Contextual Usage:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            📄 A company with no real operational activity but legally
            incorporated may be described as a <strong>legal fiction</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>
            🏛️ Often used to create artificial constructs like corporate
            personality or the presumption of paternity.
          </li>
          <li>
            📊 In business analysis, it can highlight a discrepancy between the
            appearance of legitimacy and the absence of actual governance or
            shared intent.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          <strong>In Swedish:</strong> <em>rättslig fiktion</em> — används i
          juridiska sammanhang när något behandlas som verkligt trots att det
          inte är det i praktiken.

        <p style="line-height: 1.6em">
          🇸🇪 In <u>1789</u>, Sweden launched its public debt by creating the
          Office of National Debt to fund war against Russia — despite already
          having a central bank, the <u>Riksbank</u> (founded 1668). 🏦 Instead
          of issuing sovereign money, the State chose to borrow from unnamed
          creditors — likely nobles, merchant elites, or foreign banks — without
          ever publishing a full list 🕵️‍♂️. This choice locked Sweden into a
          fiscal model where
          <strong>taxation grew to repay, not to build</strong>, and that logic
          was never reversed 🔁. Today’s income tax, employer contributions and
          VAT structure still trace back to that original decision. 📈

        <p style="line-height: 1.6em">
          💸 <strong>Tax origin:</strong> About <strong>50%</strong> of Sweden's
          national income is collected through taxes. Of that, an estimated
          <strong>25–30%</strong> comes from <u>entrepreneurs</u> (corporate
          tax, VAT, payroll fees), and the rest from individuals (income tax,
          consumption tax).
        </p>

        <p style="line-height: 1.6em">
          🧾 <strong>Tax usage:</strong> Approximately
          <strong>60–65%</strong> of that revenue is spent on public services
          (education, health, pensions). Only about <strong>1.37%</strong> goes
          to servicing the public debt — covering interest, not capital.
        </p>

        <p style="line-height: 1.6em">
          🔁 <strong>Debt mechanism:</strong> Sweden does not repay its debt
          like a household would. Instead of paying back the principal, the
          State <u>rolls the debt</u> — borrowing again to refinance maturing
          obligations. As long as market confidence holds, this cycle is
          infinite.

        <p style="line-height: 1.6em">
          🇸🇪 <strong>Debt trend:</strong> Sweden’s public debt dropped from

            departure under moral strain.
          </p>

          <p>
            It also falls within the tradition of
            <strong>Operating Principles</strong> as used by entrepreneurs and
            creators — from Naval Ravikant to Philippe Guillement — where action
            is dictated by resonance, not repetition.
          </p>

          <p>
            In my case, risk-taking was not recklessness. It was the only way to
            preserve momentum, clarity, and direction. Remaining would have
            meant dissonance, collapse, and toxic assimilation.
          </p>

          <p>
            My decision to leave was based on years of introspective discipline,
            exposure to metaphysical thinking, and a conscious rejection of
            environments that obstruct future probabilities.
          </p>

          <p>
            This is not a manifesto. It is a legal and personal record of
            coherence: a structured refusal to allow short-term dysfunction to
            hijack long-term integrity.

        During summer <strong>2000</strong> (age 23) I was studying English at
        <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Nanterre_University"
          class="subtle-link"
          >Paris-Nanterre</a
        >University while taking an introductory Dutch course. I replied to a
        Dutch student's home-swap offer, living in her Amsterdam room while she
        stayed in my studio near Paris.
      </p>

      <p>
        In <strong>2002</strong> (age 25) while living in Vichy I met a German
        woman on an intensive French course who invited me for a brief holiday;
        the visit stretched to about eight months, during which I mainly worked
        on a construction site and also taught French.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Mannheim I felt no hostile or curious looks—only the freedom of being
        an ordinary person. Surrounded by well-travelled, open people, I was
        viewed in conversation as an articulate, intelligent Frenchman rather
        than through a “Black” label.
      </p>

      <p>
        From that time I realised that
        <u><strong>living abroad would become part of my journey</strong></u
        >: it revealed <u>new opportunities</u>, and
        <u>returning home</u> became merely a brief pause before I set off again
        to <u>explore fresh perspectives</u>.
      </p>

      <p>
        In <strong>2004</strong> (age 27) I returned to the Netherlands and
        worked in several call centres. Nearing thirty (age 28) I began IT
        training to give my career structure. In
        <strong>December 2006</strong> (age 29) HP hired me near Barcelona
        before I had even finished the course.
      </p>

      <p>
        From the <strong>very first weeks</strong>, I felt a deep sense of
        <strong>alienation</strong>. I had set a clear objective:
        <strong>5 continuous years in IT</strong>, to
        <strong>build a solid CV</strong> in the
        <u>absence of college degree</u>. I spent
        <strong>2.5 years abroad</strong> in operational roles, then
        <strong>2 years in Paris</strong> working in <u>tech services</u>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In <strong>2011</strong>, I was nearly <strong>35</strong>. Without
        <strong>responsibilities</strong>, I had no reason to endure more. Had I
        stayed, I would have fallen into
        <strong>

            quiet desperation
          </a> </strong

        So I <strong>walked away</strong>—<u>without notice</u>.

      <h2>35–45 sequence</h2>

      <p>
        <strong>In 2012</strong>, I entered what I would later call my
        <strong>35–45 sequence</strong>: a phase of <strong>rejection</strong> —
        first of the <strong>corporate world</strong>, then the
        <strong>welfare state</strong>. My first move was
        <strong>Berlin</strong>, driven by a search for <u>peace</u>, away from
        <u>status games</u> and <u>toxic patterns</u>.

      <p></p>
      <p>
        After the <strong>2008 crisis</strong>, I began
        <strong>questioning the structures of power</strong>. At <u>35</u>, I
        entered <strong>Personal Development</strong>; by <u>38</u>, I
        discovered

            Venture Capitalism
          </a></strong

        until the <strong>end of COVID</strong>.
      </p>
      <h2><mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0">Building Reality</mark></h2>

      <p>
        I didn’t want guidance. I wanted to
        <strong>build my own compass</strong>. I believed there had to be a
        way—through reading, trial, and structure—to design a protocol for life.
        I wasn’t looking for spiritual peace. I was looking for
        <u>clarity, autonomy, and inner leverage</u>.
      </p>
      <h2><mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0">Venture Capitalism</mark></h2>
      <p>
        I never liked the word “startup.” What fascinated me was the logic of
        <strong>venture creation</strong>: building something radically new,
        with full creative freedom, in a space of uncertainty and high
        asymmetry. I wanted <strong>leverage without permission</strong>—a way
        to test ideas, own the upside, and stay free. It wasn’t just about
        innovation. It was about <u>the possibility of wealth through chaos</u>.
      </p>

      <h2><mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0">Power Structures</mark></h2>

      <p>
        Before any “growth,” I had already begun reading extensively on
        <u>geopolitics</u>, <u>economic systems</u>, and
        <u>power structures</u> during my final years in France I needed to
        <strong>understand the architecture of constraint</strong>. As early as
        <strong>age 33</strong>, I had already started to decode the
        <strong>political, economic and social architecture</strong> around me —
        the first axis of thought I would later define as
        <strong>System Decryption</strong>.. I spent years decoding power
        systems—politics, media, finance, welfare—until I saw how consent was
        manufactured. It wasn’t paranoia. It was self-defense.
      </p>
      <div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 20px">

        />
      </div>
      <p>
        This period, from <strong>35 to 40</strong>, became an unstructured
        curriculum. I built my own syllabus, combining
        <u>systems critique</u> with <u>metaphysical exploration</u>. It wasn’t
        coherent — but it was transformative. By 40, I had not arrived anywhere.
        But I was no longer lost.

      <h1>Upcoming Publications</h1>

      <p>
        This section will soon feature a handful of articles. Each release will
        consist of two distinct parts: a
        <strong>detailed chronological reconstruction of events</strong> and an
        <strong>autonomous legal reflection</strong> focusing on applicable
        laws, available remedies, and broader systemic issues.
      </p>

      <p>
        No more than <strong>three pairs</strong> will be published at this
        stage—<strong>six articles maximum</strong>. The objective is to explore
        formats, refine editorial tone, and prepare for a future advanced
        platform.
      </p>

      <p>
        This section previews a limited series of legal case articles — each
        composed of two distinct parts: a
        <strong>chronological reconstruction</strong> of events and a
        <strong>legal reflection</strong> grounded in Swedish labor law.
      </p>

      <p>
        The blog follows a strict editorial framework, outlined in the
        <a href="/claim.html">Position Framework</a> page. Posts are released in
        thematic pairs and serve as legal probes, case-based learning tools, or
        structured forms of response.
      </p>

      <p>
        As Friedrich Nietzsche once wrote,
        <em>"No one lies as much as an indignant man."</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        Rather than indulging in outrage, these articles aim to observe,
        document, and reflect calmly on realities that have long been part of
        the contemporary employment landscape.
      </p>

      <p>
        This current site is a <strong>foundational workspace</strong>: a place
        to establish methods, define themes, and set structural baselines before
        transitioning to a more advanced, writing-focused platform.
      </p>

      <h1>Response Rights & Legal Integrity</h1>

      <h2>🛡️ Purpose</h2>
      <p>
        This page outlines the public policy for legal interactions, factual
        rebuttals, correction requests, and the documentation of any attempts to
        suppress or informally negotiate away public interest material.
      </p>

      <h2>📣 Right of Reply</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Submit a verifiable factual correction</li>
        <li>Provide context or supporting documents</li>
        <li>Request anonymization (if justified and proportionate)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Requests will be reviewed in good faith. Valid additions or
        clarifications will be acknowledged and publicly reflected in footnotes
        or appendices.
      </p>

      <h2>☎️ Recording Policy for Calls & Outreach</h2>
      <p>
        Due to past experiences of coercion and veiled threats, all phone calls
        and voice messages <strong>may be recorded</strong> for transparency,
        archiving, and legal protection.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          This includes direct calls, intermediaries, and informal emissaries.
        </li>
        <li>
          Any interaction deemed intimidatory, manipulative, or designed to
          bypass formal channels
          <strong>may be documented and referenced</strong> in future updates.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>📨 Handling Legal Letters or Notices</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Legal communication may be summarized, quoted, or published in full.
        </li>
        <li>Identities may be anonymized unless public or legally relevant.</li>
        <li>
          Communications relying on intimidation may be publicly challenged.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>🔍 Transparency Clause</h2>
      <p>This project maintains the right to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Publicly respond to formal or informal pressure</li>
        <li>Trace outreach patterns and motives</li>
        <li>Document attempts to distort or silence structural critique</li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote>
        This archive is not a negotiation table — it is a civic documentation
        platform.
      </blockquote>

      <p>For rebuttals or formal communication:</p>

        So we have the tax added to everything the customer pays
        (<small>MOMS</small>) (12%), the tax the restaurateur pays on top of
        every salary (31.42%), the tax on <u>company profits</u> (20.6%), and

      <p><u>Rent Trap</u></p>
      <p>
        One of the most overlooked burdens for independent restaurateurs in
        <u>Lilla Torg</u> is the <strong>commercial rent</strong>. Over the past
        few years, lease prices have soared under tourist demand and speculative
        pressure, with increases
        <span style="color: #6b7280"
          >often disconnected from actual revenues</span
        >. Today, large franchises and corporate chains dominate the square,
        <strong>gradually pushing small independents out</strong>. A detailed
        analysis is available in this
        <a href="/notes/lilla-torg-rent.html" class="note_link"
          >dedicated note</a
        >.
      </p>

      <p>
        Alongside that, another silent but equally devastating force has
        emerged: <strong>inflation</strong>. Since 2022, the
        <u>price of electricity and food supplies</u> has surged dramatically.
        The war in Ukraine disrupted Europe’s supply chains,
        <span style="color: #6b7280"
          >triggering spikes in energy and agricultural costs</span
        >. Even the most disciplined restaurateurs saw their margins collapse,
        with no realistic way to pass on the costs to customers. A breakdown of
        this dynamic is provided in this

      <p><u>Intense Labor</u></p>

      <p>
        In this sector, the job extends far beyond schedules or payroll. You
        become a <u>part-time psychiatrist</u>, decoding silences, de-escalating
        tension, 'and absorbing instability.
        <u>The hardest part is not the work — it's the humans</u>.'
      </p>

      <p>
        Staffing eats 25–35% of revenue, yet salaries remain modest. The job
        requires long hours, unpredictable shifts, and multitasking under
        pressure.
        <span class="highlight"
          >The real cost isn’t just payroll — it’s turnover, burnout, and
          absenteeism</span
        >. Labor flexibility becomes both a strategy and a symptom.
      </p>

      <p>
        In my third month in Stockholm (Dec 2023), I logged
        <strong>225 hours</strong> and received <strong>28,653 SEK</strong> —
        but no payslip. It came months later, handed in an envelope, printed on
        an <strong>inkjet printer</strong>, on a
        <strong>sheet sliced with a ruler</strong>, likely from a downloadable
        <strong>Excel payslip template</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        One email later — after an <u>explicit request</u> — the same slip file
        appeared, sent by an <strong>accounting firm</strong>. It showed the
        same <strong>3 lines only</strong>: tips, hours, vacation — no OB1/OB2,
        no deductions, no bonuses. No breakdowns, no audit trail — a flattened
        sum, legally silent, strategically opaque.

        Ingredient costs spike weekly: salmon, oil, herbs, even flour. Delays

        Seasonal menus offer no protection.

        <span class="highlight">46%</span>, while average menu prices only rose
        <span class="highlight">20%</span>. Raw costs outpaced income.
        Restaurants absorbed the gap — shrinking portions, trimming staff, or

        <u>He doesn’t scale, he absorbs.</u> He doesn’t fight, he adapts. He

        is not whether he cheats — but

      <p>
        <u>First infraction: undeclared staff.</u> Too expensive, too unstable,
        too easy to justify. “It’s just a trial.” “He’s only here for the
        weekend.” “We’ll declare him next month.” But the truth is simpler:
        there’s no room in the numbers. So he disappears from the books.
      </p>

      <p>
        <u>Second infraction: hybrid contracts.</u> Half fixed, half variable.
        Clauses never applied, hours never counted. Cooks sign for 20 but work
        60. The owner knows. The staff knows. No one complains — everyone hopes
        it won’t last. It always lasts.
      </p>

      <p>
        <u>Third infraction: invisible overtime.</u> Prep starts 45 minutes
        before clock-in. Cleanup ends 30 minutes after shift-out. Lunch break
        skipped, split shifts extended. “It’s how the job is.” Everyone accepts,
        no one logs it. Time disappears. And with it, the evidence.
      </p>

      <p>
        Over time,
        <strong>these infractions stop looking like infractions</strong>.
        They’re baked into pricing, scheduling, margin projections. You can’t
        remove them — you’d have to raise prices, cut hours, or shut down. So
        they stay. And everyone stays silent.
      </p>

      <p>
        This isn’t an industry that defrauds by ambition. It’s a system that
        <u>trains people to survive through evasion</u>. That’s the real
        culture:
        <strong>not criminal intent, but institutionalized adaptation</strong>.
        What survives is what bends.

      <p><u>Financial Discrepancies</u></p>
      <p>
        Over time, I noticed not everyone was paid the same way.
        <strong>Some had full schedules, but reported little on paper.</strong>
        Others had side arrangements. This created invisible hierarchies. The
        more dependent someone was, the more toxic their behavior. One
        colleague, particularly abusive, remained untouchable.

          Ironically, the 25-year-old who raised suspicions had
          <u>back pain</u> and often asked me to lift for him. Yet he
          <a href="#" class="subtle-link">served alcohol daily</a>. Being
          labeled by him felt <strong>obscene</strong>. So I proposed a
          challenge: fail a breath test, and I’d pay 50 SEK or
          <strong>run 10 km at 10 km/h</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Later, I learned "Tutti" — an Indonesian server in her 50s, very kind
          — drank regularly after her shift. Colleagues tolerated it, sometimes
          serving her directly. On Saturdays, she asked me to escort her to the
          train; most other days, she used a different station. It had always
          struck me as odd.
        </p>

        <p>
          I proposed a breath-test challenge: fail and I’d pay 50 SEK or
          <strong>run 10 km at 10 km/h</strong>. The
          <strong>owner left the group instantly</strong>. Only later did I
          realize: he used his
          <strong>personal breathalyzer 2–3 times a week</strong> — before
          driving.
        </p>

        <p>
          When I joked, he replied,
          <em>“Patrice, you can’t take a joke.”</em> But I’ve seen addiction up
          close. I only drink <strong>red wine</strong>, never more than 3
          glasses, and never without
          <strong>red meat, cheese, or charcuterie</strong>.
          <strong>Beer tastes like piss to me.</strong>
          <strong>Bear Testline Piece</strong>.

          2.
          <strong>First Glimpse: The Dishwasher Job in Hamburg (2012)</strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          In April–May 2017, I worked as a dishwasher at
          <a
            href="https://www.das-strandrestaurant.de/"
            class="subtle-link"
            target="_blank"
            >Das Strandrestaurant</a
          >, in the Rostock coastal region. The place served 75 guests a day. I
          cleaned the machine area and took initiative to restore the back
          facade and staff zone.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nobody said a word. No warnings, no frowns.
          <strong>It was routine</strong>. And yet this man was giving orders,
          shaping service, barking instructions at the staff. When I told the
          owner, her only response was, “I’ll talk to him.”
          <span class="highlight">Nothing changed</span>.

          3. Ex-Girlfriend Waitress Saw 3 Alcoholic Chefs in 6 Years in
          Australia
        </h2>
        <p>
          Later, my partner—who had spent six years as a waitress in
          Australia—confirmed what I’d seen. She recalled
          <strong>cooks getting drunk mid-shift</strong>, treating it like a
          badge of honour. I began to see a broader pattern: kitchens where
          alcohol wasn’t hidden but <strong>normalized</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          This wasn’t just about indulgence. It was about silence. A culture
          where
          <strong>denial, tolerance, and complicity</strong> formed a triangle
          of dysfunction. I’ve been the odd one out my whole life—<strong
            >the guy at the club drinking soda</strong
          >. When I spoke out, I was met with disbelief, deflection, and
          sometimes outright hostility.

        <h2>The Loyalty Contract</h2>
        <p>
          When someone
          <strong>trusts you, feeds you, listens to you</strong>—you want to
          give back. I filled in when needed. I cleaned more than asked. That
          mutual understanding kept everything running. Even if unspoken.
        </p>
        <p>
          In some restaurants, leniency is not a managerial style — it’s a
          shield. Employers allow small rule-bending in exchange for loyalty and
          silence. You get to snack, check your phone, stay a little loose — as
          long as you don't destabilize the structure or speak too much.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            I spent 14 months as a dishwasher in a high-volume establishment
            where I was paid on time, listened to, and respected.
          </li>
          <li>
            We were encouraged to rest during downtime. No one punished phone
            use during calm periods.
          </li>
          <li>
            The chef wanted smooth operations and no drama. That attitude shaped
            the atmosphere for everyone.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p><u>Loyalty Through Trust</u></p>
        <p>
          My manager never interrogated my movements. That kind of restraint
          earns you loyalty. And I gave it. Even now, I struggle to criticize
          him publicly—not because everything was flawless, but because his
          <strong>human decency</strong> was real.
        </p>

        <p><u>Systemic Tolerance of Toxicity</u></p>
        <p>
          The staff was mostly Turkish. A long-time Greek cook—<strong
            >loud, degrading, and borderline cruel</strong
          >—was tolerated. Management stayed silent, waiting for him to leave on
          his own terms. <strong>Silence was easier than confrontation.</strong>
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="culture-block" id="culture-silence">
        <h2 id="culture-silence">Culture of Silence</h2>

        <p><u>Unspoken Rules and Invisible Limits</u></p>
        <p>
          The freedoms were real. <strong>No one clock-watched.</strong> I could
          vanish for 45 minutes, take breaks as I wished, even start shifts two
          hours before any activity. Presence only mattered when it mattered.
          But beneath that liberty was <strong>silent monitoring</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Dishwashing shifts ran in <strong>flexible pairs</strong>. If one
          didn’t show, the other adapted—no explanations needed. It was a
          workplace built on trust—but <strong>bounded by silence</strong>.
        </p>
        <h2>The Line I Never Crossed</h2>
        <p>
          And because of that, I can’t betray him. I’ve seen things—but I won’t
          speak of them here.
          <strong>He gave me space. He gave me dignity.</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          Everyone knows what not to say. Complaints stay inside. Problems get
          absorbed by the team — not solved. The silence is not passive; it's a
          strategic, distributed defense. If no one speaks, no one gets exposed.
        </p>

        <p><u>Silent Control</u></p>
        <p>
          At Da Peppe Due, the system was more polished.
          <strong>Nothing was explicit—but everything was controlled.</strong>
          The manager never raised his voice. He didn’t micromanage. His mere
          presence shaped how people behaved. It wasn’t fear—it was calibration.
        </p>

        <p>
          What struck me most wasn’t discipline—it was
          <strong>generosity</strong>. From day one, I was paid properly,
          allowed to eat premium meals, and encouraged to ask for raises. This
          kindness created an invisible contract: enjoy everything,
          <strong>as long as you don’t cross a line</strong>.
        </p>

        <p><u>Quiet Generosity</u></p>
        <p>
          Despite the flaws, generosity flowed. Former staff, kids, and friends
          of the owner often ate for free. No announcement, no posters—just an
          <strong>unspoken rule of belonging</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          I was paid fully and on time. Once, after a delay, I received a bank
          transfer within hours. He listened to me. He offered more than I
          asked. And I <strong>refused his Facebook request</strong>—not out of
          spite, but to maintain boundaries. He wasn’t trying to impress anyone.
          He was just kind.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            The law may not always be followed, but respect can compensate. That
            was the deal.
          </li>
          <li>
            At that restaurant, I had access to quality meals, flexible breaks,
            and autonomy—all without fear.
          </li>
          <li>
            I was even offered a raise without asking. These gestures forged a
            kind of social contract.

        <h2>Culture of Secrecy</h2>
        <p>
          My restaurant background spans roughly <strong>two years</strong>,
          with the longest stretch—<strong>14 months</strong>—spent at
          <u>Da Peppe Due</u> in Stockholm. This job coincided with a moment
          where I became more observant of what made a kitchen thrive—or quietly
          rot.
        </p>

        <p>
          One of my first shocks came during a
          <strong>trial shift at RIPIG</strong>. I offered to work two unpaid
          hours. The owner panicked and ordered me to clock in
          <em>immediately</em>. Her tone revealed a deep-seated fear:
          <strong>legality here meant invisibility</strong>, not compliance.
          That moment marked my first encounter with the sector's unwritten
          rules.
        </p>

        <h2>Resentment of Vitality</h2>
        <p>
          In a kitchen running on <strong>fatigue and inertia</strong>, my
          energy—fueled by sleep, nutrition, and training—became suspicious. I
          moved fast, lifted heavy, stayed alert. Others resented that. It felt
          absurd to be <strong>whispered about simply for being alive</strong>.
        </p>

        <h2 id="culture-evasion">Culture of Evasion</h2>

        <p>
          Evasion doesn’t scream. It whispers. Contracts unsigned, slips
          delayed, trails erased. Everything is there — just never all at once.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>1. Missing documents, missing responsibilities.</b>
          No onboarding papers. Payslips delayed, partial, or absent. When
          pressure comes, nothing formal can be held.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>2. Accounting opacity as method.</b>
          External accounting firms issue neutral slips — 3 lines, no context.
          Details fade: no overtime, no tax logic, no breakdowns. Visibility is
          optional.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>3. Bankruptcy as exit strategy.</b>
          When claims rise, structures collapse. Companies fold, partners
          vanish, and no one stays accountable. It’s not disappearance — it’s a
          reset.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>4. Hidden ownership, offshore instincts.</b>
          Ownership passes through wives, brothers, or ghost firms. Sometimes
          offshore, always unnamed. Secrecy isn’t the tactic — it’s the
          framework.
        </p>

        <h2>Standing My Ground</h2>
        <p>
          In the early months, a server tried to boss me around. I drew a line:
          I belonged to the kitchen, not the floor. The manager pulled me
          aside—not to shout, but to warn. I adapted. I
          <strong>learned the hierarchy</strong>. And I stayed 14 months.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h2>Quan's Failure Was Not Structural—It Was Personal</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Quan's setup wasn’t impossible. The real failure came from how one
          person enforced it.
        </li>
        <li>

        <li>
          Had someone else been in charge, I might have stayed. It wasn't the
          floor plan. It was the leadership.

      <h1>Weak Signals</h1>

      <p>
        On <strong>November 16</strong>, I sent a spontaneous application to
        <strong>Quan</strong>. I was aware the restaurant was attached to a
        hotel, but only during my trial shift did I fully realize the extent of
        its integration within a <strong>4-star hotel</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Many of my early questions—about dishware, trolleys, or food
        storage—were answered with “it’s for the hotel.” I deduced that the
        entire food and conference service, including breakfast, was run by the
        same company, but no clear onboarding ever explained these overlaps. The
        structure remained opaque.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>
          <a
            href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1s6uTnBQCgQGC0qQVsxj-ili6KFA7bZ1/view?usp=sharing"
            >around 2 PM</a
          >
        </strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        Her familiarity felt disproportionate coming from someone I’d never met.
        I responded politely but awkwardly, unsure who she was. When she and
        Henrik entered the meeting room together, she naturally led the
        conversation. That’s when I assumed she was
        <strong>in charge of the restaurant</strong>—someone with practical
        authority beyond her official title.
      </p>

      <p>
        No one introduced her or confirmed her title. Later, colleagues casually
        referred to her as <em>“the boss.”</em> I had no reason to doubt it. I
        only discovered much later she was
        <strong>formally listed as Deputy Board Member</strong>—a position that
        carries no formal management authority in Sweden.
      </p>

      <p>
        That gap between perceived authority and official status didn’t strike
        me immediately, but it shaped a subtle confusion. I adapted to her
        leadership as if she were the founder or legal manager. At no point was
        I told otherwise.
      </p>

      <p>
        That ambiguity had immediate consequences: moments earlier, I had
        greeted several team members, including a
        <strong>floor manager</strong> I’d bonded with during my shift. He
        ignored my handshake. In retrospect, I interpreted this as a reaction to
        my rushed greeting to her—possibly seen as a
        <strong>lack of deference to the executive lead</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The session itself was warm.
        <strong>Henrik showed visible enthusiasm</strong>, while Sahar remained
        measured but positive. Both seemed relieved to have found someone
        <em>“reliable”</em>. I, too, felt I had landed in the right place,
        though I sensed a slight mismatch between Sahar’s informal posture and
        the authority she embodied.
      </p>
      <p>
        The tone was enthusiastic. They expressed visible relief at finding
        someone “reliable.” They emphasized three principles:
        <strong>punctuality</strong>, <strong>exclusive availability</strong>,
        and <strong>attention to detail</strong>—framed as missing virtues in
        their previous hires.
      </p>

      <p>
        I was offered an hourly rate of <strong>160 SEK/h</strong> on the spot,
        based on my CV and the trial performance. I disclosed an existing
        weekend job, which Sahar acknowledged without hesitation, even framing
        it as a sign of integrity.
      </p>

      <p>
        During that meeting,
        <strong>Sahar mentioned a digital contract</strong> would be sent. I
        expected it within days, but no document ever arrived. No login
        credentials, no confirmation, no follow-up. The promise remained
        unfulfilled despite clear mutual agreement.
      </p>

      <p>
        I also raised a condition: receiving a share of <strong>tips</strong>.
        They said the matter would be discussed with the floor and bar managers.
        A few days later, both confirmed their approval individually. No
        contract followed, but Sahar briefly mentioned one would—possibly via
        their internal system. That mention was never repeated.
      </p>
      <p>
        Throughout this period,
        <strong>my only point of contact was Henrik</strong>. His number was the
        only one I received. Any attempt to address questions or follow up—about
        schedules, duties, or documents—was redirected:
        <em>“I'll ask Sahar.”</em> Eventually,
        <strong>I stopped asking</strong>. He often seemed embarrassed or
        reluctant.
      </p>

      <p>
        When he was absent, I was told to ask the <strong>sous-chefs</strong>.
        That proved even more difficult. Their responses felt dismissive, and I
        quickly sensed that <strong>pushing further was unwelcome</strong>. I
        began submitting written questions to the restaurant’s general email.
        These were not challenged, but I knew
        <strong>they fell outside accepted channels</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The meeting lasted approximately <strong>30 minutes</strong>, between
        <strong>13:53 and 14:28</strong>, as confirmed in my Google Timeline.
        Though informal in tone, it set the
        <strong>essential terms of work</strong> and gave rise to what I
        interpreted as the <strong>start of formal employment</strong>.

      <h1>The Emergence of a Model</h1>
      <h2 class="subtitleh2">Outsourced Neo-Asian Restauranting</h2>

      <h3>📌 <span style="font-size: 1.2rem; font-weight: 600">2015</span></h3>
      <p>
        By <strong>2015</strong>, Henrik is understood to have joined
        <strong>Renaissance Hotel Malmö</strong> (then under
        <strong>Marriott</strong> branding). He gradually took over
        <strong>food and beverage operations</strong>, reportedly holding that
        role for two and a half years by <strong>2018</strong>.
      </p>

      <h3>📌 <span style="font-size: 1.2rem; font-weight: 600">2016</span></h3>

      📎 <strong>December 12</strong>, <strong>Saahil</strong> (36) restructures
      his personal company — formerly known as <u>Saahil AB</u>
      <span class="highlight">(reg. no. 556881-0641)</span> — renaming it
      <strong>Chudasama Invest AB</strong>. The shift adopts the
      <a href="notes.html#note-invest-ab" class="subtle-link">Invest AB</a>
      format, signaling a transition from personal branding to structured asset
      holding.

      <h3>📌 <span style="font-size: 1.2rem; font-weight: 600">2017</span></h3>
      <p>
        <strong>On July 14</strong>,
        <a href="#">Sliders and Shakes AB</a> (559119-7628) was created by
        <strong>Saahil</strong> (37), <strong>Alexander Zinnert</strong> (44)
        and <strong>Darine El Nasser</strong> (39). The team launched a venue
        focused on miniature gourmet burgers and handcrafted milkshakes, based
        at <a href="#">Malmö Central Station</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        A few months later, <strong>Darine</strong> was replaced by
        <strong>Sachin Gore</strong> (36), former Five Guys UK national
        director. At that point, <strong>Saahil</strong> and
        <strong>Alexander</strong> held the majority of shares (50/50), with
        Zinnert as chairman, Saahil as board member, and Gore joining as deputy.
      </p>
      <h3>📌 <span style="font-size: 1.2rem; font-weight: 600">2018</span></h3>

      <p>
        <strong>On January 23</strong>, the official registry of
        <u>verkliga huvudmän</u> listed <strong>Alexander Zinnert</strong> as
        the sole beneficial owner of
        <span class="highlight">Sliders and Shakes AB</span>, with over 25%
        control. No other shareholder, including Saahil Chudasama or Sachin
        Gore, was registered as holding effective authority.
      </p>

          >luxury-label franchise operated under the Marriott group</span
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        Its dedicated vehicle <strong>Elite Rosen Malmö AB</strong> assumed
        control and temporarily <a href="#">rebranded the venue</a> as
        <strong>Elite Hotel Adlon</strong>. The transition marked both the
        <span style="color: #666">end of the Renaissance identity</span> and the
        likely <span style="color: #666">loss of its five-star status</span>.

        <strong>HSSC Event AB</strong> (registration no.
        <strong>559163-2764</strong>) is officially registered in Malmö. Its

        📌 All other companies introduced in this sequence are likewise

        <span class="highlight">21.2 million SEK</span> in revenue. Net monthly
        profit reached <strong>8,665 SEK</strong>, yielding a

          ><strong>flux tendu</strong></a
        >, with minimal retention.
      </p>
      <p>
        Personnel costs absorbed <strong>49%</strong> of gross revenue, while
        <u>dividends issued by Chudasama Invest AB</u> reached
        <span class="highlight">56,855 SEK/month</span> — representing
        <strong>≈ 90%</strong> of the year’s total profits. This confirms that

      <h3>📌 <span style="font-size: 1.2rem; font-weight: 600">2020</span></h3>

      <p>
        📄 <strong>On 30 September</strong>, company no.
        <strong>559274-2042</strong> is registered under the name KEHDA Holding
        AB. Its declared purpose is <u>property and asset management</u>,…with
        initial control held by
        <strong>Bolagsstiftarna appointees (as in 2012)</strong> — all replaced
        weeks later by Daniella Lin Dahl.
      </p>

      <p>
        📌 Despite reporting
        <u>no employees, clients, or listed assignments</u>, KEHDA votes four
        consecutive <strong>profit distributions</strong> between 2021 and 2024,
        totaling <strong>over 1.2 million SEK</strong>. At least one appears
        linked to
        <span style="background-color: #e5e7eb"
          >strategic advisory billing from HSSC Event AB</span
        >, without itemized explanation.
      </p>

      <p>
        🧩 The setup suggests a <u>silent profit vehicle</u>: KEHDA operates
        without public presence, while its sole representative shares a
        residence with <strong>Henrik Siebert</strong>. This may indicate a
        <span style="background-color: #e5e7eb">private holding layer</span>,
        designed to channel earnings while shielding visible ownership.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>As of December 31</strong>, <u>HSSC Event AB</u> employed
        <span class="highlight">10 people</span> and generated
        <span class="highlight">16.3 million SEK</span> in revenue —
        <u>23% down</u> from 2019. Despite this, net profit rose to
        <strong>≈1.18 million SEK</strong> — a <u>+1270% increase</u> — yielding
        a <strong>net margin of 7.25%</strong>.
        <span class="highlight">No dividends were issued</span>, and profits
        were fully retained.
      </p>

      <p>
        This marks a break from the previous
        <a href="notes.html#fluxtendu" class="subtle-link">flux tendu</a> logic,
        suggesting a strategic pause in distribution. The change coincides with
        the creation of KEHDA Holding AB (30 Sept), yet no direct outflows were
        recorded that year.
      </p>

      <p>
        <u>CHUDASAMA Invest AB</u>, still holding 33% of shares, reported
        <strong>0 SEK in revenue</strong> and a net loss of
        <strong>−28,777 SEK</strong>. Its equity remained at
        <span class="highlight">851,443 SEK</span>, with
        <strong>no dividends received</strong>. In practical terms, the vehicle
        held capital but served no active role — confirming a deliberate halt in
        extraction.

      <p>
        <strong>On 25 January</strong>, Sliders and Shakes AB disclosed
        liabilities of <strong>1.3 M SEK</strong>, including
        <span class="highlight">a 1 M SEK loan from Danske Bank</span>. The
        company’s assets amounted to just <strong>26 K SEK</strong>, confirming
        <u>a critical insolvency gap</u>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The company’s shares were held by
        <strong>CHUDASAMA Invest AB</strong> (556881-0641),
        <strong>Alexander Sebastian Invest AB</strong> (556742-9427), and
        <strong>Sachin Gore</strong>...
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>On February 20</strong>, Restaurang Steakhouse Lilla Torg AB
        registered a <strong>Tesla Model Y</strong> under leasing. The vehicle
        is not registered in the name of any board member, but its use remains
        undocumented.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>On March 4</strong>, a second <strong>Tesla Model Y</strong> was
        leased by the same company, which employs around 20 staff. The vehicle
        is likely used by individuals close to daily operations.
      </p>
      <p>
        📄
        <strong>On July 1st</strong>,
        <strong>Tributum AB</strong> (<u>559488-5476</u>) was formally
        registered at <strong>Mäster Johansgatan 15, Malmö</strong>. Its stated
        business is <span class="highlight">restaurant operations</span> under
        code 56100. The address matches that of <u>HSSC</u> and <u>KEHDA</u>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The board of <strong>Tributum AB</strong> includes
        <strong>Daniella Dahl</strong> as chair and
        <strong>Sahar El Nasser</strong> as deputy.
        <u>Both hold individual signing authority</u> and are linked to other
        entities in the Quan group.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ownership is split between <strong>KEHDA Holding AB</strong> (<span
          class="highlight"
          >75%</span
        >) and <strong>Sahar El Nasser</strong> (<u>25%</u>).
        <u>No beneficial owner</u> is listed in the Swedish registry.
      </p>

      <p></p>
      <p>
        <strong>Aspiratio Holding AB</strong> (<u>559488-5484</u>) was
        registered on the same day and at the same address, but under
        <u>c/o KEHDA Holding AB</u>. It declares
        <span class="highlight">asset and property management</span> as its
        business purpose.
      </p>

      <p>
        As of registration, <strong>Aspiratio</strong> has
        <u>no F-tax status</u>, <u>no VAT registration</u>,
        <u>no employer contributions</u>. The company appears
        <strong>dormant or inactive on paper</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The board structure mirrors Tributum:
        <strong>Sahar El Nasser</strong> is now chair, with
        <strong>Daniella Dahl</strong> as deputy. Their reversed roles suggest a
        <u>shared internal control</u> across distinct entities.
      </p>

      <p>
        Both firms were purchased from <strong>Bolagsstiftarna AB</strong>,
        known for pre-registered shelf companies. Their dual setup indicates a
        <span class="highlight"
          >clear separation between operational control and legal
          ownership</span
        >.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>On December 8</strong>, a first high-end vehicle — a BMW 330E
        Xdrive — was registered under HSSC Event's name via leasing.
        <span class="highlight"
          >No personal car appears linked to the two women listed in official
          structures</span
        >.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>On December 15</strong>,
        <span class="highlight">Daniela</span> is listed as beneficial owner of
        <strong>C8 Communicate AB</strong> (ownership <strong>≤ 25%</strong>),
        alongside <span class="highlight">Patrik Lindfors</span> (ownership
        <strong>50–75%</strong>). This initiative reportedly aligns with another
        project Henrik was focused on at the time.
      </p>

      <h3>📌 <span style="font-size: 1.2rem; font-weight: 600">2025</span></h3>

      <p>
        <strong>On April 29</strong>, a second vehicle — a Porsche Taycan 4S —
        was added under the same leasing scheme as the first. This confirms a
        pattern of <strong>company-based access to premium vehicles</strong>,
        though ownership intent remains unverified.
      </p>
      <p>
        Quan operates physically within the premises of Elite Hotel Esplanade,
        at Mäster Johansgatan 15 in Malmö. While customers often believe they
        are dealing directly with hotel staff,
        <strong
          >the restaurant is managed independently, under separate legal
          entities</strong
        >.
      </p>

      <p>
        A quick search in the Swedish business register confirmed that
        <strong>HSSC Event AB</strong> was the legal entity linked to the
        restaurant. It listed <strong>Sahar El Nasser</strong> as
        <em>suppleant</em> (alternate board member), with no other listed
        responsibilities at that time.
      </p>

      <p>
        On public business directories such as <strong>Allabolag</strong>, the
        structure of <em>HSSC Event AB</em> appears minimal. The company is
        registered at the same address as Quan Restaurant, yet no explicit
        reference to the restaurant is made.
      </p>

      <p>
        Only two names are listed:
        <strong>Alexander Saahil Chudasama</strong> (ledamot) and
        <strong>Sahar El Nasser</strong> (suppleant). No shareholder information
        or operational description is available beyond this bare minimum.
      </p>

      <p>
        Meanwhile, <strong>Chudasama Invest AB</strong>, held by Alexander
        Chudasama, owns under 25% of shares. However, the 2021 Articles of
        Association grant him rights to appoint and dismiss the majority of the
        board, giving him de facto operational control.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Lin Daniella Dahl</strong> and
        <strong>Henrik Kei Siebert</strong> are both registered at the same
        residential address in Trelleborg. Their shared domicile suggests a
        likely domestic relationship, although not formally stated in company
        documents.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Sahar El Nasser</strong> and
        <strong>Alexander Saahil Chudasama</strong> also appear as cohabitants
        in Malmö, based on population registry data. This co-residency
        reinforces the possibility of internal alignment in the governance of
        HSSC Event AB.
      </p>

      <p>
        Though visibly committed during those shifts, his involvement remained
        minimal outside of them. He stayed socially distant, rarely interacting
        with staff or showing signs of operational leadership.
      </p>
      <p>
        What stood out to me was the
        <strong
          >complete absence of communication between Henrik and Sahar</strong
        >. During my three weeks at Quan, I never saw them speak or exchange
        even a glance. For someone trying to understand their role, this silence
        was striking.
      </p>

      <p>
        No public record directly links <strong>Elite Hotels</strong> and
        <strong>HSSC Event AB</strong>. However, both companies officially
        operate from the same address:
        <strong>Mäster Johansgatan 15, Malmö</strong>. This overlap may indicate
        a tenancy or subcontracting arrangement, but the absence of published
        contracts prevents confirmation.

            <strong>About the Purpose of This Log</strong>
          </summary>

          <p>
            Publishing these technical and editorial logs serves a clear and
            deliberate purpose. Beyond documenting the construction of the
            Aftershift blog, this public log is designed to proactively
            demonstrate discipline, transparency, and continuity throughout the
            development process.
          </p>

          <p>
            Although no law requires an individual to publish construction logs,
            this initiative is guided by important principles recognized in
            Swedish and European contexts:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Good faith (God tro)</strong>: Acting in a loyal, honest,
              and serious manner during disputes or work-related actions.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Burden of proof (Bevisbörda)</strong>: Taking
              responsibility for proving one's claims when challenged.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong
                >Best documentation practices (spirit of
                Dokumentationsskyldighet)</strong
              >: Ensuring traceability and integrity through verifiable records.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Maintaining this public log also provides a defense against
            potential allegations that could arise in the context of employment
            disputes, such as:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Bad faith</strong> – Continuous documentation shows
              commitment and seriousness.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Disorganization</strong> – Structured updates demonstrate
              methodical work.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Abandonment of efforts</strong> – Regular updates confirm
              ongoing engagement.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Improvisation or chaotic behavior</strong> – Recorded
              evolution shows planning and consistency.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Retroactive falsification</strong> – Timestamped updates
              prevent any suspicion of post hoc fabrication.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            In Swedish legal practice, behavior is often judged not only on
            strict laws but also on the parties' credibility, rigor, and
            seriousness. By maintaining this verifiable log, Aftershift
            reinforces its credibility and integrity in a transparent,
            professional manner.

      <h1>Working Dynamics</h1>

      <!-- <section class="narrative-intro">
        <p>
          This part continues the <em>narrative grid</em> — a pragmatic label
          for a three-part structure used to examine how a conflict was shaped
          through its early framing, internal operations, and implicit power
          dynamics.
        </p>

          <summary class="section-order">
            🔄 <strong>Part 2 — Process Narrative</strong>
          </summary>

          <p>
            <strong>Function:</strong> This section reconstructs how work
            actually unfolded — who gave instructions, who took charge, and how
            roles shifted beyond official titles or contracts.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Fields:</strong> Known as a
            <strong>process narrative</strong> (HR),
            <strong>functional ethnography</strong> (sociology), or
            <strong>workflow mapping</strong> (audit). All describe how systems
            operate below the surface.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Usage:</strong> Used by compliance officers, workplace
            mediators, and researchers to clarify informal routines, relational
            tensions, and decision patterns that don’t appear in formal
            hierarchies.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Adaptation:</strong> This section captures how fragmented
            authority and social silences shaped daily life. It tracks where
            guidance came from, who avoided responsibility, and how staff
            compensated through informal channels.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Structure:</strong> The narrative follows a chronological
            logic, grounded in first-person memory and interaction flow. It
            prioritizes lived routines over documentation.

        <h2>Sahar's Front Role</h2>

        <p>
          <strong>Sahar was only present two or three days a week</strong>, and
          when she was there, she acted as a
          <strong>stressed-out waitress, not a manager</strong>, unavailable,
          and never proactively communicative.
        </p>

        <p>
          I was never invited to discuss my role or expectations. I was just a
          dishwasher, and she was the boss.
          <strong>She never introduced herself</strong>. .
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>From the outset</strong>, I quickly realised I had no clear
          point of contact.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>She never asked me how I was doing</strong>.I never received
          an invitation to discuss problems or expectations with her.
          <strong>She gave me basic instructions</strong>—such as keeping the
          hotel corridor clean—but
          <strong>never engaged in any managerial dialogue</strong>.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="saahil-shadow-strategy">
        <h2>Saahil's Shadow Strategy</h2>

        <p>
          Over time, I learned
          <strong>Sahar was married to the founder</strong>, who was best
          friends with Henrik. This
          <strong>lack of shared leadership</strong> permeated the workplace and
          made me rely on trial-and-error and informal channels to understand my
          role.
        </p>

        <p>
          It was only after a few days on site that I discovered the restaurant
          was legally operated by <strong>HSSC Event AB</strong>—not Quan, nor
          Elite Hotel. The name appeared in the internal scheduling platform
          <strong>Personalkollen</strong>, which employees used to access shift
          information.
        </p>

        <p>
          Despite this, <strong>quanbyquan.se</strong> has been actively used
          for internal communication. At least four domain-linked emails were
          confirmed as active: hs, se, hk, and
          <strong>sc@quanbyquan.se</strong>. Delivery receipts confirm messages
          reached these recipients.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Henrik Kei Sieber</strong>, publicly introduced as the lead
          figure behind Quan, maintained a
          <strong>discreet yet regular presence</strong>. I observed him working
          no more than two to three days a week, typically welcoming guests and
          overseeing the front-of-house with focused attention.

        <h2>Fragmented Leadership Style</h2>

        <p>
          I had <strong>no HR, no staff coordinator</strong>, and no one in a
          defined role to address workplace questions. The entire structure ran
          on proxy and inference.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>The result was clear: I had to manage on my own</strong>. I
          needed answers, but found no one to ask. Eventually I emailed the
          restaurant directly. No one contested this, but I could tell
          <strong>it wasn’t how things were supposed to be done</strong>. They
          had been looking for a dishwasher for months. I got positive feedback
          from many coworkers. Several told me I was doing a great job.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Henrik, the co-gerant, was polite but distant</strong>. We
          exchanged maybe three words in three weeks. He showed interest in the
          music I listened to once, and that’s how I learned he spoke Japanese.
          <strong>He never introduced himself</strong>. Everything else I
          learned about him came from colleagues.
          <strong>At no point could I tell he had any managerial role</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          I tried to reach Sahar by email after an incident with cleaners I
          hadn’t been informed about. Her response confirmed the vague
          structure:
          <strong
            >I was offered to replace them, as if this was a known path</strong
          >.
        </p>

          <strong
            >The management triangle (Sahar, Henrik, and the co-manager)</strong
          >
          was disconnected. They rarely spoke. I never once saw Sahar and Henrik
          (co-gérant) interact or stand side-by-side.
        </p>

        <h2>Silent Power Structure</h2>

        <p>
          Quan operates physically within the premises of Elite Hotel Esplanade,
          at Mäster Johansgatan 15 in Malmö. While customers often believe they
          are dealing directly with hotel staff,
          <strong
            >the restaurant is managed independently, under separate legal
            entities</strong
          >.
        </p>

        <p>
          The integration is <strong>logistical rather than visual</strong>:
          Quan shares the physical space of the hotel, but
          <strong
            >employment and managerial responsibilities are externalized to
            private companies</strong
          >
          with no direct affiliation to the Elite Hotels group.
        </p>

        <p>
          When I first considered applying at Quan, I conducted a standard
          ownership check to tailor my motivation email.
          <strong
            >Henrik Kei Siebert was the only visible public figure linked to the
            restaurant</strong

        <h2>Asymmetrical Relations</h2>

        <p>
          <strong>Henrik (the chef)</strong> gave me practical instructions
          early on, like where to put the trash and where to get cleaning
          supplies. He was courteous, distant but always respectful.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Sub-chefs quickly showed limits</strong>. They helped with
          small tasks but their body language made it clear not to insist. I
          stopped asking them anything beyond essentials.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>So I stopped trying</strong>. I started talking more with the
          waiters. With a few exceptions,
          <strong>they were helpful and pleasant</strong>. The general vibe was
          good. People seemed happy to be there.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>There was laughter, music, a sense of energy</strong>. Even if
          Sahar created some tension sometimes (like firing a waitress in front
          of me), the team was mostly upbeat. I believe this was largely due to
          good salaries. One bartender even told me this was the best
          opportunity he’d found after years in the field.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Only the waiters were approachable</strong>, mostly kind and
          supportive. There was a generally good atmosphere among staff—many
          seemed happy, possibly due to decent pay and tips.

        <p>
          Two chefs, <strong>Robin Albay Dinopol</strong> and
          <strong>Satoru Yoshizawa</strong>, who were regularly scheduled on
          evening shifts, were later identified as the sole partners of
          <strong>BURI Handelsbolag</strong> (org.nr 969798-6447). Their company
          is not listed as a subcontractor, but they both worked onsite as
          cooks.
        </p>

        <p>
          This configuration raises the possibility of
          <strong>undeclared subcontracting</strong>, where staff are employed
          through a third-party vehicle without formal declaration. No document
          or contract was disclosed to clarify the terms of their engagement
          with Quan or HSSC Event AB.
        </p>

        <p>
          Another <strong>external subcontractor</strong> was regularly observed
          on site every Friday night. A cleaning couple arrived at approximately
          <strong>23:30</strong> and remained on site until around
          <strong>04:00</strong>, working four hours each.

          Their presence accounted for a total of
          <strong>eight hours per session</strong>. They were not listed on any
          official schedule, and no company name or contractual arrangement was
          ever disclosed. Management suggested I might be asked to
          <strong>replace them</strong> due to dissatisfaction with their work.

        <p>
          On that evening, I was struck by a mix of
          <span class="highlight">anxiety</span>, <strong>impunity</strong>, and
          a form of <u>adolescent insolence</u>—openly assumed and left
          unchecked—that deeply puzzled me. It triggered a kind of
          <strong>electroshock</strong>, a confrontation, and a forced
          conversation to bring clarity I never had.
