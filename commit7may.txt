---        <p><strong>Quan</strong> is a restaurant, but not a registered company. A search in the Swedish company registry yields no results under that name. It appears to function as a <strong>brand</strong>, not a legal entity.</p>
--+      <details open style="background-color: #e5e7eb; border-radius: 0.6rem; padding: 1.5rem; margin: 1.5rem 0; line-height: 1.65;">
--+        <summary style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.05rem;"><strong>Historical Background of Governance</strong></summary>
--+        <p>In <strong>2005</strong>, <strong>Henrik Siebert</strong> began managing a family-owned restaurant, reportedly entrusted to him to launch his professional career, and he soon established himself as both its <strong>general manager</strong> and public face.</p>
-- 
---        <p>Upon arrival, I was directed to enter through the <strong>Elite Hotel</strong>. Quan operates physically within the hotel premises. No signage, uniform, or internal communication displayed its own corporate identity.</p>
---        
---        <p>The domain <strong>quanbyquan.se</strong> was registered on <strong>24 August 2018</strong> and remains active to this day (over six years). WHOIS records reveal no owner identity. No legal entity or <em>impressum</em> is mentioned on the site.</p>
---        
---        <p>Swedish law (Act 2002:562) requires e-commerce and hospitality sites to disclose their operator. The Quan site contains <strong>no VAT number, company name, or legal contact</strong>.</p>
---        
---        <p>Using the Wayback Machine, over <strong>45 snapshots</strong> from 2018–2024 were reviewed. No version ever included legal information, reinforcing the structural opacity of the domain's ownership.</p>
---        
---        <p>Despite this, the domain <strong>quanbyquan.se</strong> is used for professional email communication. Three addresses were verified as active: <strong>hs@</strong>, <strong>sc@</strong>, and <strong>hk@quanbyquan.se</strong>.</p>
--+        <p>In <strong>2007</strong>, a serious altercation erupted between <strong>Siebert</strong> and his head chef, resulting in a physical confrontation and a lawsuit in <strong>labour court</strong>, which concluded in <strong>January 2008</strong> with a decision in Sibert’s favour despite some public controversy.</p>
--+      
--+        <p>In <strong>2008</strong>, <strong>Saahil Chudasama</strong> appeared in company records as a <strong>Deputy Board Member</strong>, while no formal documentation listed Sibert as a shareholder or executive officer of the operating entity.</p>
--+      
--+      
--+      
--+        <p>
--+          In <strong>2012</strong>, ownership was transferred to <strong>Etagegruppen</strong>. From that point on, neither Chudasama nor Siebert appear in the structure. Henrik, however, remained publicly associated with the restaurant until its transfer.
--+        </p>
--+      
--+        <p>
--+          By <strong>2014</strong>, Henrik is understood to have joined <strong>Renaissance Hotel Malmö</strong> (then under <strong>Marriott</strong> branding). He gradually took over <strong>food and beverage operations</strong>, reportedly holding that role for two and a half years by <strong>2018</strong>.
--+        </p>
--+      
--+        <p>
--+          In <strong>February 2018</strong>, the Renaissance Hotel was acquired by a Swedish group and renamed <strong>Elite Hotel Adlon</strong>. Shortly after, the restaurant project <strong>Quan</strong> was launched on the same premises. Henrik Siebert was introduced as <strong>concept lead</strong> and <strong>co-manager</strong>.
--+        </p>
--+      
--+      </details>
--+      <p>
--+        Quan operates physically within the premises of Elite Hotel Esplanade, at Mäster Johansgatan 15 in Malmö. While customers often believe they are dealing directly with hotel staff, <strong>the restaurant is managed independently, under separate legal entities</strong>.
--+        </p>
--         
---        <p>These addresses correspond to <strong>Henrik Siebert</strong>, <strong>Sahar El Nasser</strong>, and <strong>Alexander Saahil Chudasama</strong>. All of them confirmed receipt of a formal letter in <strong>January 2025</strong>.</p>
--+        <p>
--+        The integration is <strong>logistical rather than visual</strong>: Quan shares the physical space of the hotel, but <strong>employment and managerial responsibilities are externalized to private companies</strong> with no direct affiliation to the Elite Hotels group.
--+        </p>
--         
---        <p>Weeks into the job, I discovered the restaurant was operated by <strong>HSSC Event AB</strong>, not Elite Hotel. This became visible when I accessed the internal planning platform <strong>Personalkollum</strong>.</p>
--+        <p>
--+        When I first considered applying at Quan, I conducted a standard ownership check to tailor my motivation email. <strong>Henrik Kei Siebert was the only visible public figure linked to the restaurant</strong>, repeatedly cited in hotel communications and online articles as its founder.
--+        </p>
--         
---        <p><strong>HSSC Event AB</strong> was incorporated on <strong>25 June 2018</strong> by <strong>Alexander Saahil Chudasama</strong>. Its registration number is <strong>559163-2764</strong>. <strong>Sahar El Nasser</strong> is listed as an alternate board member (<em>suppleant</em>).</p>
--+        <p>
--+        <strong>No trace of a distinct legal entity operating Quan appeared in public records</strong>, which left me uncertain about whom to address—and forced me to send a generic, unpersonalized message.
--+        </p>
-- 
--         <p>
---          The company name <strong>HSSC Event AB</strong> does not formally list <strong>Henrik Siebert</strong> among its board members. However, the initials <strong>HSSC</strong> match the combination of <strong>Henrik Siebert (HS)</strong> and <strong>Sahil Chudasama (SC)</strong>, two individuals closely tied to the project. This strongly suggests that the name was derived from their identities.
--+          It was only after a few days on site that I discovered the restaurant was legally operated by <strong>HSSC Event AB</strong>—not Quan, nor Elite Hotel. The name appeared in the internal scheduling platform <strong>Personalkollen</strong>, which employees used to access shift information.
--           </p>
---        
---        <p>According to the <strong>Swedish ownership register</strong>, <strong>Lin Daniella Dahl</strong> holds between <strong>50–75%</strong> of HSSC Event AB via <strong>KEHDA Holding AB</strong>. She is not referenced on the restaurant's website or in internal documents.</p>
---        
---        <p><strong>Chudasama Invest AB</strong>, owned by Alexander Chudasama, holds <strong>less than 25%</strong> of shares. However, he has the right to appoint and dismiss the majority of board members.</p>
---        
---        <p>This governance clause gives Alexander <strong>effective control</strong> of the company, even without majority ownership. His presence is confirmed by field reports and internal emails.</p>
---        
---        <p><strong>Henrik Siebert</strong> does not appear in official company documents. His email under the domain suggests a <strong>non-registered but active role</strong> in Quan’s operations.</p>
---        
---        <p><strong>Sahar El Nasser</strong>, although not listed as an owner, was the only managerial figure on site. Her status as <em>suppleant</em> indicates a formal link without legal authority over company direction.</p>
--+          
--+          <p>
--+          My job interview had been conducted by a woman who introduced herself as <strong>Sahar</strong>—"like Sahara", she said. Only later, by cross-checking the name in Personalkollen, did I understand she held a formal role within <strong>HSSC Event AB</strong>.
--+          </p>
--+          
--+          <p>
--+            A quick search in the Swedish business register confirmed that <strong>HSSC Event AB</strong> was the legal entity linked to the restaurant. It listed <strong>Sahar El Nasser</strong> as <em>suppleant</em> (alternate board member), with no other listed responsibilities at that time.
--+            </p>
--+            
--+            <p>
--+            Despite this, <strong>Henrik Kei Siebert</strong>—the only visible public figure associated with Quan—did not appear anywhere in official records. His absence from the company’s registration was surprising, given his public role and occasional presence on site.
--+            </p>
--+            <p>On public business directories such as <strong>Allabolag</strong>, the structure of <em>HSSC Event AB</em> appears minimal. The company is registered at the same address as Quan Restaurant, yet no explicit reference to the restaurant is made.</p>
-- 
---        <p>In <strong>June 2024</strong>, a new entity named <strong>Tributum AB</strong> was incorporated under organisation number <strong>559488-5476</strong>. It shares the same address as Quan and HSSC Event AB: <strong>Mäster Johansgatan 15, Malmö</strong>, the location of the Elite Hotel.</p>
--+<p>Only two names are listed: <strong>Alexander Saahil Chudasama</strong> (ledamot) and <strong>Sahar El Nasser</strong> (suppleant). No shareholder information or operational description is available beyond this bare minimum.</p>
--+      
--+<p><strong>According to the Swedish Beneficial Ownership Register</strong>, HSSC Event AB is controlled by KEHDA Holding AB, through which Lin Daniella Dahl holds between 50–75% of the shares. Her name is absent from operational documents and restaurant-facing materials.</p>
--+     
--+<p>Meanwhile, <strong>Chudasama Invest AB</strong>, held by Alexander Chudasama, owns under 25% of shares. However, the 2021 Articles of Association grant him rights to appoint and dismiss the majority of the board, giving him de facto operational control.</p>
-- 
---        <p>The company lists <strong>Henrik Kei Siebert</strong> as <em>verkställande direktör</em> (external CEO), <strong>Sahar El Nasser</strong> as <em>ledamot</em> (board member), and <strong>Lin Daniella Dahl</strong> as <em>suppleant</em> (board deputy). These appointments form a coherent triangle of decision-making involving the same individuals previously connected to Quan.</p>
---        
---        <p><strong>Daniella Dahl</strong> is officially registered at the same residential address in Trelleborg as Henrik Siebert. This may indicate a domestic or familial connection, though this is not confirmed in official company filings. Their shared involvement in the company strengthens the perception of a jointly coordinated initiative.</p>
---        
---        <p><strong>Tributum AB</strong> was registered with a clear declared business activity: <strong>restaurangverksamhet</strong> (restaurant operations). This represents a contrast with the structurally opaque profile of HSSC Event AB, which never publicly disclosed its corporate purpose nor maintained a visible legal imprint on Quan’s communications.</p>
---        
---        <p>Despite this formal declaration, <strong>Tributum AB has never issued payslips or registered any employment documents</strong> with the HRAK unemployment fund, at least in relation to the complainant. It remains a dormant entity on paper, showing <strong>no revenue, no registered staff, and no known operations</strong> to date.</p>
---        
---        <p>Whether <strong>Tributum AB</strong> was designed to replace, absorb, or complement <strong>HSSC Event AB</strong> is still unclear. However, the continuity in <strong>address</strong>, <strong>management</strong>, and <strong>declared purpose</strong> strongly suggests that these entities are structurally interconnected. Their combined presence within the same premises indicates a coordinated ecosystem managed by the same group of individuals.</p>
--+<p>
--+  <strong>Lin Daniella Dahl</strong> and <strong>Henrik Kei Siebert</strong> are both registered at the same residential address in Trelleborg. Their shared domicile suggests a likely domestic relationship, although not formally stated in company documents.
--+</p>
--+
--+<p>
--+  <strong>Sahar El Nasser</strong> and <strong>Alexander Saahil Chudasama</strong> also appear as cohabitants in Malmö, based on population registry data. This co-residency reinforces the possibility of internal alignment in the governance of HSSC Event AB.

--+  <summary>⚖️ Legal Note: Beneficial Ownership and Coordination of Responsibilities</summary><br>
--+
--+
--+  <p>
--+    Under EU Directive 2015/849 on anti-money laundering, Swedish companies must register their <em>verklig huvudman</em> (beneficial owner) separately from board representatives. This aims to prevent opaque control structures.
--+  </p>
--+
--+  <p>
--+    In the case of HSSC Event AB, public board data lists Mr. Chudasama and Ms. El Nasser, while the Beneficial Ownership Register identifies Ms. Dahl as majority owner via KEHDA Holding AB—absent from operational materials.
--+  </p>
--+
--+  <p>
--+    This divergence reflects a deliberate <strong>liability compartmentalization</strong> strategy: responsibilities are split across entities and persons, shielding accountability behind formal roles.
--+  </p>
--+
--+  <p>
--+    Personal records reveal cross-linked domestic ties: Ms. Dahl cohabits with Mr. Siebert, and Ms. El Nasser with Mr. Chudasama. While not illegal, such dual alignments reinforce internal control patterns not visible in legal filings.
--+  </p>
--+  <p>The company name <strong>HSSC</strong> appears to derive from the initials of <strong>H</strong>enrik Kei <strong>S</strong>iebert (<strong>HS</strong>) and Alexander<strong> S</strong>aahil <strong>C</strong>hudasama (<strong>SC</strong>). This naming pattern reinforces their underlying influence, despite limited mention in legal or operational records.</p>
--+  </strong></p></details>

--+  The domain <strong>quanbyquan.se</strong>, which has hosted Quan’s website since 2018, was registered on <strong>24 August 2018</strong>. WHOIS data discloses no owner identity, and the site contains no <em>impressum</em> or corporate details.
--+  </p>
--+  
--+  <p>
--+  Swedish law (<a href="https://lagen.nu/2002:562#P8S1" target="_blank">Act 2002:562</a>) requires hospitality sites to disclose a VAT number, legal operator, and contact. Over 45 archived snapshots (2018–2024) confirm none of these elements ever appeared on the site.
--+  </p>
--+  
--+  <p>
--+  Despite this, <strong>quanbyquan.se</strong> has been actively used for internal communication. At least four domain-linked emails were confirmed as active: hs, se, hk, and <strong>sc@quanbyquan.se</strong>. Delivery receipts confirm messages reached these recipients.

--+    <summary>⚖️ Legal Note: Legal Disclosure Obligations for Commercial Websites</summary><br>
--+  
--+    Most jurisdictions—including Sweden—require commercial websites to identify their legal operator. In Sweden, this is enforced by the <a href="https://lagen.nu/2002:562#P8S1" target="_blank">E-commerce Act (2002:562)</a>, which mandates clear display of the company name, organisation number, VAT ID, and contact details.
--+  
--+    <br><br>
--+  
--+    This transparency protects consumers and employees, facilitates accountability, and ensures traceability of online businesses. Similar obligations exist across the EU, Germany (<em>Impressumspflicht</em>), and France (mentions légales), among others.
--+  
--+    <br><br>
--+  
--+    Omission of such disclosures is not always illegal, but it typically indicates either informal structuring or intent to limit visibility, which can obstruct due diligence or legal recourse in case of dispute.
--+  </details>
--+
--+  <p>
--+    Throughout my three weeks of employment at Quan, <strong>Saahil Chudasama</strong>—officially listed as a co-owner—was <strong>never seen on-site</strong>. No colleague ever mentioned him, and his name played no role in daily operations.
--+  </p>
--+  <p>
--+    <strong>Henrik Kei Sieber</strong>, publicly introduced as the lead figure behind Quan, maintained a <strong>discreet yet regular presence</strong>. I observed him working no more than two to three days a week, typically welcoming guests and overseeing the front-of-house with focused attention.
--+  </p>
--+  
--+  <p>
--+    Though visibly committed during those shifts, his involvement remained minimal outside of them. He stayed socially distant, rarely interacting with staff or showing signs of operational leadership.
--+  </p>
--+  <p>
--+    What stood out to me was the <strong>complete absence of communication between Henrik and Sahar</strong>. During my three weeks at Quan, I never saw them speak or exchange even a glance. For someone trying to understand their role, this silence was striking.
--+  </p>
--+  
--+  <p>
--+    Henrik’s role appeared <strong>detached from the daily team flow</strong>. I never witnessed him share a joke, give a directive, or interact casually with staff. From my position in the back kitchen, he always seemed removed, even when physically present.
--+  </p>
--+  
--+  <p>
--+    By contrast, <strong>Sahar was visibly active in team coordination</strong>. I saw her engage directly with the floor manager, the head chef, and multiple sous-chefs—often inside the kitchen. She also managed interviews and subcontractor issues. There was no doubt she operated at the core of daily operations.
--+  </p>
--+  <details open style="background-color: #e5e7eb; border-radius: 0.6rem; padding: 1.5rem; margin: 1.5rem 0; line-height: 1.6;">
--+    <summary>📌 Structural Note: Informal Leadership, Formal Incorporation</summary><br>
--+  
--+    No internal communication or shared leadership structure was visible during the <strong>observed period</strong>. Staff routines followed <strong>practical rather than hierarchical logic</strong>, with no direct managerial access linked to the <strong>two registered owners</strong>.<br><br>
--+  
--+    This model coexisted with <strong>remarkable financial output</strong>—reportedly over 5 million SEK in net profit in 2023, and <strong>3 weeks of advance booking</strong> at all times. The later registration of <em>Tributum AB</em> may indicate a step toward structural consolidation or <em>structural clarity</em>.
--+  </details>
--+
--+
--+  <p><strong>On July 1st, 2024</strong>, two new legal entities were incorporated on the same day: <strong>Tributum AB</strong> and <strong>Aspiratio Holding AB</strong>. Both companies list board members directly connected to Quan and share the exact same address: <em>Mäster Johansgatan 15, Malmö</em> — the known location of Quan, HSSC Event AB, and Elite Hotel.</p>
--+
--+  <p>Tributum AB officially declared a business activity of <strong>restaurant operations (restaurangverksamhet)</strong>. Its board includes <strong>Henrik Kei Siebert</strong> as CEO, <strong>Sahar El Nasser</strong> as board member, and <strong>Lin Daniella Dahl</strong> as deputy. This configuration mirrors operational roles already observed at Quan.</p>
--+  
--+  <p>By contrast, <strong>Aspiratio Holding AB</strong> is formally registered under <em>c/o Kehda Holding AB</em>, but still at the same Malmö address. Despite being legally active, Aspiratio shows <strong>no declared business activity</strong>, <strong>no F-tax registration</strong>, <strong>no VAT (Moms)</strong>, and <strong>no employer contributions</strong>.</p>
--+  
--+  <p>Its board lists <strong>Lin Daniella Dahl</strong> as chair and <strong>Sahar El Nasser</strong> as deputy — forming the same tandem involved in Tributum, with overlapping but formally distinct roles. Both entities were created simultaneously and appear dormant or inactive on paper.</p>
--+  
--+  <p>This synchronised registration raises strategic questions. While <em>Tributum AB</em> was presented as a formal clarification of restaurant activity, <em>Aspiratio</em> could serve as a <em>holding or fallback structure</em>, or as a shielded platform disconnected from declared payroll operations.</p>
--+  
--+  <details open style="background-color: #e5e7eb; border-radius: 0.6rem; padding: 1.5rem; margin: 1.5rem 0; line-height: 1.6;">
--+    <summary>📌 Structural Insight: Dual Entities, Silent Repositioning</summary>
--+    
--+    <p>The mirrored setup of <strong>Tributum AB</strong> and <strong>Aspiratio Holding AB</strong>, both created on July 1st at the same address, goes beyond <strong>administrative convenience</strong>. Their design suggests an attempt to <strong>redistribute roles</strong>, <strong>separate exposures</strong>, and <strong>clarify legal responsibility</strong>.</p>
--+    
--+    <p>While Tributum declared active restaurant operations, <strong>Aspiratio remains structurally dormant</strong>: no payroll, no declared business. This silent setup may offer <strong>future flexibility</strong>, <strong>discreet compensation flows</strong>, or <strong>risk management</strong> beyond the main operation.</p>    <p>This dual setup could act as a <strong>buffer</strong>—absorbing pressure, shielding liability, or preparing for change—without public disclosure or fiscal trace.</p>
--+    </details>
-- 
---        <p>
---          Although <strong>Alexander Sahil Chudasama</strong> is officially recorded as founder and lead board member of HSSC Event AB, he was <strong>never present</strong> on site during the entire period I worked at Quan. His absence was consistent and total, despite his formal status as the person holding the company’s registration and signing authority.
---          </p>
---          
--           <p>
--           Alexander Chudasama is reportedly active at another restaurant location elsewhere in Malmö, suggesting that <strong>his operational involvement at Quan was outsourced or delegated</strong> entirely. This further supports the impression of a layered governance system, where legal responsibility is separated from daily managerial presence.

--      <h2>
--        First Article: <em>On Dismissal by Text</em> (Om uppsägning via SMS)
--      </h2>
--
--      <p>
--        Across industries, from anonymous workers to famous CEOs and
--        professional sports coaches, dismissals have often adopted the form of a
--        <strong>coward elegance</strong>: swift, discreet, and elegantly
--        detached, avoiding the direct confrontation of a traditional
--        face-to-face dismissal, which though painful, retains a certain
--        nobility.
--      </p>
--
--      <p>
--        These practices reflect less a conscious cruelty than a blend of urgent
--        pragmatism and <strong>efficient contempt</strong>, treating individuals
--        not as unique beings but as disposable assets — echoing, perhaps, the
--        raw cynicism embedded in the term "Human Resources."
--      </p>
--
-       <p>
--        Drawing from personal experience and broader examples, the articles will
--        examine:
-+        This section previews a limited series of legal case articles — each
-+        composed of two distinct parts: a
-+        <strong>chronological reconstruction</strong> of events and a
-+        <strong>legal reflection</strong> grounded in Swedish labor law.
-       </p>
--      <ul>
--        <li>What constitutes a valid resignation?</li>
--        <li>What is the purpose of a notice period?</li>
--        <li>How can an employment contract be terminated?</li>
--        <li>Is a <strong>friendly procedure</strong> legally acceptable?</li>
--        <li>
--          What concrete remedies are available to contest such dismissals?
--        </li>
--      </ul>
- 
-       <p>
--        Each article pair will serve as an
--        <strong>exercise in style and structure</strong>, setting the
--        foundations for the editorial DNA of the future platform.
-+        The blog follows a strict editorial framework, outlined in the
-+        <a href="/claim.html">Position Framework</a> page. Posts are released in
-+        thematic pairs and serve as legal probes, case-based learning tools, or
-+        structured forms of response.
-       </p>
- 
-       <p>
--        The first article is nearing completion and will be released when the
--        foundations feel right.

-+    
-+      <p>
-+        This article adopts what is commonly referred to as a <strong>Circumstantial Exposition Model</strong>: a hybrid structure designed to document real-life incidents with both narrative clarity and legal coherence.
-+      </p>
-+    
-+      <p>
-+        It combines chronological narration, factual anchoring, and interpretive layers to support legal, journalistic, or institutional assessments.</p>
-+        
-+       <p> In <strong>legal writing</strong>, this structure appears as a case brief or factual memorandum.</p> 
-+        
-+       <p> In <strong>investigative journalism</strong>, it is reflected in timeline-driven exposés.</p>
-+        
-+       <p>In <strong>academic research</strong>, the format resembles case-centered reflections.</p>
-+        
-+       <p> In <strong>HR or compliance contexts</strong>, it parallels whistleblower reports.</p>
-+    
-+      <p>
-+        The core objective is to track events as they unfold, qualify breaches, and assess consequences — without fictionalising or speculating. It supports both evidentiary scrutiny and systemic analysis.
-+      </p>
-+
-+      <p>
-+        This model combines <strong>chronological narration</strong> and <strong>factual anchoring</strong> with interpretive layers — offering a method suited for documenting workplace disputes or legal infractions without dramatization.
-+      </p>
-+      
-+      <p>
-+        In this article, the chosen <strong>perspective</strong> is first-person: all facts are narrated by the individual directly affected, and grounded in <strong>verifiable documentation</strong>. This supports both legal coherence and narrative legitimacy.

-       At <strong>6:35 AM</strong> on <strong>December 14, 2024</strong>, after a work shift that ended slightly earlier than usual, I sent a message to management proposing to take a short break. The message included an additional note: if the proposal was not accepted, they could interpret the text as a resignation.

-+            This section expands the prior <a href="/context.html"><strong>Context</strong></a> page. It focuses on how the workplace functioned day-to-day, beyond formal contracts or job descriptions.
-+          </p>
-+        
-+          <p>
-+            In institutional or academic settings, this type of analysis resembles what is sometimes called a <strong>functional ethnography</strong> (in sociology), or a <strong>process narrative</strong> (in HR or compliance auditing). It prioritizes informal workflows, interpersonal dynamics, and observed behavioural routines.
-+          </p>
-+        
-+          <p>
-+            In this case, the term <strong>Working Dynamics</strong> refers to what the workplace felt like in practice — who made decisions, how instructions were passed, and how the absence of clear managerial structures shaped the experience of work.
-+          </p>
-+        
-+          <p>
-+            Unlike legal claims or evidentiary timelines, this section emphasizes <strong>social roles, silences, disconnections, and improvisation</strong> — all of which help explain the relational gaps that ultimately led to conflict.
-+          </p>

+          <p>
+            This section documents the continuous technical and editorial
+            adjustments made to the blog.
+          </p>
+          <p>
+            In accordance with general principles of evidence and transparency,
+            each update is timestamped to ensure the traceability and integrity
+            of modifications over time.
+          </p>
+          <p>
+            All timestamps recorded here correspond to the precise moment when
+            the changes became effective and publicly visible online, in line
+            with recognized standards of probative value in digital
+            communications.
+          </p>
+          <p>
+            In this section, each update corresponds to what is technically

+            <strong>About the Purpose of This Log</strong>
+          </summary>
+
+          <p>
+            Publishing these technical and editorial logs serves a clear and
+            deliberate purpose. Beyond documenting the construction of the
+            Aftershift blog, this public log is designed to proactively
+            demonstrate discipline, transparency, and continuity throughout the
+            development process.
+          </p>
+
+          <p>
+            Although no law requires an individual to publish construction logs,
+            this initiative is guided by important principles recognized in
+            Swedish and European contexts:
+          </p>
+
+          <ul>
+            <li>
+              <strong>Good faith (God tro)</strong>: Acting in a loyal, honest,
+              and serious manner during disputes or work-related actions.
+            </li>
+            <li>
+              <strong>Burden of proof (Bevisbörda)</strong>: Taking
+              responsibility for proving one's claims when challenged.
+            </li>
+            <li>
+              <strong
+                >Best documentation practices (spirit of
+                Dokumentationsskyldighet)</strong
+              >: Ensuring traceability and integrity through verifiable records.
+            </li>
+          </ul>
+
+          <p>
+            Maintaining this public log also provides a defense against
+            potential allegations that could arise in the context of employment
+            disputes, such as:
+          </p>
+
+          <ul>
+            <li>
+              <strong>Bad faith</strong> – Continuous documentation shows
+              commitment and seriousness.
+            </li>
+            <li>
+              <strong>Disorganization</strong> – Structured updates demonstrate
+              methodical work.
+            </li>
+            <li>
+              <strong>Abandonment of efforts</strong> – Regular updates confirm
+              ongoing engagement.
+            </li>
+            <li>
+              <strong>Improvisation or chaotic behavior</strong> – Recorded
+              evolution shows planning and consistency.
+            </li>
+            <li>
+              <strong>Retroactive falsification</strong> – Timestamped updates
+              prevent any suspicion of post hoc fabrication.
+            </li>
+          </ul>
+
+          <p>
+            In Swedish legal practice, behavior is often judged not only on
+            strict laws but also on the parties' credibility, rigor, and
+            seriousness. By maintaining this verifiable log, Aftershift
+            reinforces its credibility and integrity in a transparent,
+            professional manner.
