          <strong>📌 Note — Auditor Appointment Requirement in Sweden</strong>
        </summary>

        <p style="line-height: 1.5">
          Under Swedish law (<em>Årsredovisningslagen</em>), limited companies
          must appoint a statutory auditor if they exceed
          <strong>2 out of 3 thresholds</strong> for
          <u>two consecutive years</u>:
        </p>

        <table style="font-size: 0.9em; margin-bottom: 1em">

              <th>Threshold</th>
              <th>Typical Source</th>
            </tr>

            <tr>
              <td>Balance sheet total</td>
              <td>> 1.5 MSEK</td>
              <td>Annual report or credit report</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Net turnover</td>
              <td>> 3 MSEK</td>
              <td>Annual report or credit report</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Employees (average)</td>

        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
          In the case of <strong>HSSC Event AB</strong>, the 2023 credit report
          shows the following growth trajectory:
        </p>

        <ul style="margin-bottom: 1em">
          <li><strong>2021</strong> → 11.3 MSEK turnover</li>
          <li><strong>2022</strong> → 22.9 MSEK</li>
          <li><strong>2023</strong> → 40.5 MSEK, with <u>21 employees</u></li>
        </ul>

        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
          <strong>🧾 Conclusion</strong> — If the company had >3 employees and
          >3 MSEK in turnover as early as 2020 (likely given the curve), it
          triggered the legal obligation to appoint an auditor by
          <strong>2021</strong>.
        </p>

        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
          Its appointment on <strong>10 May 2021</strong> may reflect a
          <u>late compliance adjustment</u> — a common occurrence among
          fast-scaling private firms. Not a scandal, but a useful forensic
          marker.

      <details id="note-holding-purpose">
        <summary><strong>📎 Note — Role of a Holding Company</strong></summary>
        <p style="line-height: 1.5">
          A <strong>holding company</strong> is a legal structure created to
          <u>own shares in one or more other companies</u>, often without any
          direct operational activity. Its primary purpose is to
          <u>consolidate control and centralize profits</u>, typically through
          the reception of dividends.
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.5">
          In Sweden, this structure is widely used for
          <strong>tax optimization</strong>: profits received by the holding are
          usually tax-exempt, and personal income from dividends can be deferred
          or distributed under more favorable tax brackets (typically
          <strong>20–30%</strong> under the “3:12 rules”).
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.5">
          This setup is <u>legal and common</u>, especially among entrepreneurs
          and founders. However, when combined with
          <em>limited transparency</em>, it can make it harder to identify the
          true financial beneficiaries behind a company’s profits.
        </p>

      <details id="note-property-asset">
        <summary><strong>📎 Note — Property & Asset Manager</strong></summary>

        <p style="line-height: 1.6">
          A <strong>property & asset manager</strong> is a type of company that
          doesn't sell anything or run a daily business. Instead, it's often
          used to
          <span style="background-color: #e5e7eb"
            ><strong>own things</strong> (like real estate or shares)</span
          >
          and <strong>get paid</strong> from them.
        </p>

        <p style="line-height: 1.6">
          For example, some restaurateurs use one company to run the restaurant,
          and
          <span style="background-color: #e5e7eb"
            ><strong>another company to own the building</strong></span
          >
          or receive rent. This setup can also help
          <u><strong>finance a personal apartment</strong></u> or protect family
          property.
        </p>

        <p style="line-height: 1.6">
          It's a <strong>common and legal structure</strong>, especially when
          people want to <u>separate risk and income</u>, or when they want to
          <u>pay themselves differently</u> — not as salary, but through other
          income.

        <summary><strong>📌 Note — What’s an “Invest AB”?</strong></summary>

        <p style="line-height: 1.6em">
          The <strong>“Invest AB”</strong> suffix — short for
          <em>Investment Aktiebolag</em> — doesn’t always imply an active
          investment firm. In Swedish business practice, it often means a
          company used for
          <strong>holding, shielding, or managing income</strong> through a
          separate legal structure.
        </p>

        <p style="line-height: 1.6em">
          The model is popular among restaurateurs and service professionals.
          Instead of drawing a salary (which is taxed at a higher rate), they
          channel earnings into their Invest AB, pay lower corporate tax, and
          later <u>withdraw dividends</u> at favorable rates.
        </p>

        <p style="line-height: 1.6em">
          In Malmö’s hospitality scene, dozens of “Invest AB” entities serve to
          <u>buy family apartments</u>, <u>own restaurant buildings</u>, or
          simply <u>shield liability</u>. It’s a quiet way of
          <span style="background-color: #e5e7eb"
            ><strong
              >separating private control from operational exposure</strong
            ></span
          >.
        </p>

        <p style="line-height: 1.6em">
          This strategy gained traction post-2006 tax reforms in Sweden, and is
          now a common template for service-heavy or risk-prone sectors.

          Most jurisdictions—including Sweden—require commercial websites to
          identify their legal operator. In Sweden, this is enforced by the
          <strong>E-commerce Act (2002:562)</strong>, which mandates clear
          display of the <u>company name, organisation number, VAT ID</u>, and
          contact details.

        <p style="line-height: 1.6em">
          Omission of such disclosures is not always illegal, but it typically

          <strong>⚖️ Note — Board Member vs. Effective Owner</strong>
        </summary>

        <p style="line-height: 1.6em">
          In Swedish company law, a
          <strong>board member</strong> (styrelseledamot) is the official legal
          figure associated with governance. But in practice, this role is often
          used to <u>signal legitimacy</u> or
          <span class="highlight">front a corporate structure</span>
          without reflecting who truly controls the business.
        </p>

        <p style="line-height: 1.6em">
          According to <strong>EU Directive 2015/849</strong>, the
          <em>beneficial owner</em> (verklig huvudman) must be disclosed
          separately — typically the person who ultimately owns or controls the
          entity. This aims to
          <span class="highlight">prevent opacity</span> and deter misuse of
          legal facades.
        </p>

        <p style="line-height: 1.6em">
          In sectors like hospitality or nightlife, it’s common to find
          <strong>proxy board members</strong> (e.g. family, accountant,
          long-time friend) while real power is exercised by someone else —
          often due to <u>reputation concerns</u>, past legal trouble, or the
          need to stay out of public documents.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the case of <strong>HHSC Event AB</strong>, for instance,
          <strong>Mr. Henrik Siebert</strong>, widely acknowledged as a key
          architect of the <em>Quan</em> project,
          <u>does not appear in any official filing</u>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Instead, <strong>Saahil Chudasama</strong> and
          <strong>Sahar El Nasser</strong> are listed as <u>board members</u>,
          while <span class="highlight">the majority stake (50–75%)</span> is
          held by <strong>Ms. Dahl</strong>, and
          <span class="highlight">Mr. Chudasama holds between 0 and 25%</span>
          of the shares.
        </p>

        <p style="line-height: 1.6em">
          This discrepancy suggests a
          <strong>protective distancing</strong> strategy:
          <u>separating operational control from legal exposure</u>. In cases
          like these, the board may reflect not power, but <em>cover</em>.

        </summary>

        <p style="line-height: 1.6em">
          In many hospitality ventures,
          <strong>board members listed in legal filings</strong> are not the
          actual initiators or operators. Instead, they often act as
          <u>legal proxies</u> for visibility-sensitive founders, allowing for
          discretion, operational distancing, or reputational shielding.
        </p>

        <p style="line-height: 1.6em">
          The case of
          <span class="highlight"
            >Henrik Siebert’s absence from the board of HSSC Event AB</span
          >, despite his public role in launching Quan, points to a likely
          strategy of <strong>protective distancing</strong>. This setup enables
          the true initiator to
          <u>control strategy and execution from the background</u>, while
          ensuring no formal tie appears in commercial registries.
        </p>

        <p style="line-height: 1.6em">
          In high-end properties—especially those operating under
          <strong>Marriott International</strong> or
          <strong>Elite Hotels of Sweden</strong>—such distancing may even be
          required. Large hotel groups often <u>conduct internal vetting</u> and
          avoid contracting with individuals involved in prior disputes,
          reputational risk, or internal conflicts. This can lead to private
          conditions requiring founders to remain out of legal view, using
          <span class="highlight">“clean” board members</span> as interface.
        </p>

        <p style="line-height: 1.6em">
          While not inherently illegal, this practice blurs the lines between
          <u>ownership, control, and liability</u>. It can be used to obscure
          lines of accountability and delay consequences in case of legal
          disputes, financial mismanagement, or employee claims.
        </p>

        <p style="line-height: 1.6em">
          In Sweden, the 2015 EU directive on money laundering requires
          companies to register a
          <strong>verklig huvudman</strong> (beneficial owner), separate from
          the board, to limit such opacity. Yet in practice,
          <u
            >many shelf-company setups or private agreements still allow
            circumvention</u

          <strong>Etagegruppen AB</strong> (org. 556402-6697) is a regional
          hospitality group founded on <strong>July 25, 1990</strong> by
          <strong>Michael Hagqvist</strong> (21), to operate the Malmö nightclub
          <strong>Etage</strong>, located at
          <span class="highlight">Stortorget 6</span>. The venue, originally
          opened in the 1980s, became one of the largest clubs in the city with
          <span class="highlight">4 dance floors and a karaoke bar</span>, and
          has remained an iconic nightlife spot.
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.6em">
          During the 2000s, Etagegruppen expanded its footprint in Malmö with a
          portfolio including:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Centiliter & Gram</strong> (created 2007, opened 2008) – a
            premium cocktail bar (Stortorget 17), popular among the 25+ crowd;
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Goose Bar & Restaurang</strong> (launched 2010) – a casual
            pub-restaurant near Gustav Adolfs Torg;
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Club operations at Hotel Scandic Crown</strong> – under the
            names <em>Level</em> (mainstream) and <em>Wonk</em> (LGBT+), active
            since 2011.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <!-- Avant la liste -->
        <p>
          By 2012, the group simultaneously managed
          <span class="highlight"
            >Etage, Centiliter & Gram, Goose, and Level/Wonk</span
          >, employing cross-venue synergies in marketing, ticketing, and HR.

          In <strong>April 2012</strong>, Etagegruppen acquired
          <strong>Izakaya Koi AB</strong> (556765-3844), absorbing its
          operational structure but preserving its original name and atmosphere.
        </p>

        <p>
          This marked the closure of the <em>Henrik Siebert era</em> and
          consolidated Etagegruppen’s control over key nightlife assets in
          Malmö’s central square.

        <p style="line-height: 1.6em">
          Etagegruppen’s reputation remains solid in Malmö’s nightlife scene. In
          2013, its parent company posted revenues of
          <strong>~5.5 million SEK</strong> (excluding subsidiaries), and its
          venues are regularly featured in nightlife guides. Hagqvist has also
          acted as a semi-official spokesperson for local business owners,
          including public opposition to restrictive terrace regulations.

        <p style="line-height: 1.6em">
          In many cases, the **salary is not a reflection of actual profit**,
          but a strategic benchmark. A business owner might earn more through
          dividends, leasing benefits, or reinvested company funds, but declares
          a stable salary for optics and structure.
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.6em">
          Some patterns observed across restaurants and consultancies:
        </p>
        <ul style="line-height: 1.6em">
          <li>
            <strong>Daniela:</strong> ≈30,000 SEK net/month – stable and modest
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Henrik:</strong> 31,000 SEK net/month – just under state tax
            limit
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Sahar:</strong> ~41,000 SEK net/month – close to threshold,
            but possibly offset by deductions
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p style="line-height: 1.6em">
          These salaries offer an ideal balance: they are
          <strong>visible, plausible, and sustainable</strong>. They avoid
          scrutiny while preserving access to administrative benefits. In some
          cases, they may also help reduce the perceived need to explain or
          justify dividends.
        </p>
        <ul style="line-height: 1.6em">
          <li>
            <strong>✅ Avoids assumptions of under-declaration</strong> (too
            low)
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong

          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>✅ Creates a "normal" middle-class profile</strong> without
            excessive exposure
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p style="line-height: 1.6em">
          This strategy is often part of a broader compensation plan where
          salary is just one element. Others include:

          </li>
        </ul>
        <p style="line-height: 1.6em">
          In doing so, the entrepreneur achieves three things at once: (1) a
          steady, credible income line; (2) reduced tax load; and (3) minimal
          personal exposure.
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.6em">
          In most cases, <strong>30k–45k SEK net/month</strong> appears to be a
          psychological and fiscal “sweet spot” — high enough to look
          legitimate, low enough to remain under the radar. This is especially
          relevant in **high-turnover, high-cash sectors** like restaurants,
          catering, and events.
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.6em">
          It also enables long-term administrative consistency: social security
          contributions, pension points, and sickness insurance are all linked
          to declared salary — not to dividends.
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.6em">
          <strong>📌 Summary:</strong> Restaurateurs often pick salary levels
          that are <strong>just below the national tax cliff</strong> while
          satisfying social and legal visibility requirements. This gives them
          legitimacy, flexibility, and protection — without inviting audits or
          raising questions.

          was a <u>deep trench filled with water</u> built around a castle,
          acting as a physical defense system against invaders. Its purpose was
          to protect the stronghold by making access difficult and dangerous. 🏰
        </p>

        <p style="line-height: 1.6em">
          The term <strong>"moat"</strong> was later adopted in finance by

          <u>cost leadership</u> — that protects profits over time.
        </p>

        <p style="line-height: 1.6em">
          A company rated as <strong>“No Moat”</strong> by Morningstar is seen
          as <span class="highlight">vulnerable to competitive erosion</span>.
          It lacks pricing power, customer lock-in, or meaningful scale

        <p style="line-height: 1.6em">
          In the restaurant sector — especially in

          🗣️ <strong>Term origin:</strong> <em>Affectio societatis</em> is a

          "<em>willingness to form a company</em>". It refers to the mutual

          <strong>Definition:</strong> A <em>legal fiction</em> is a fact
          assumed or created by courts, legislatures, or institutions to apply a
          legal rule. It allows the law to treat something as true or existing
          even if it is not, strictly speaking, the case.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Origin:</strong> Latin expression <em>“fictio juris”</em> —
          widely used in Roman law and revived in modern legal theory. The
          French term <strong>fiction juridique</strong> translates precisely to
          <strong>legal fiction</strong> in English and to
          <strong>rättslig fiktion</strong> in Swedish.

          <li>
            📄 A company with no real operational activity but legally

          🇸🇪 In <u>1789</u>, Sweden launched its public debt by creating the
          Office of National Debt to fund war against Russia — despite already
          having a central bank, the <u>Riksbank</u> (founded 1668). 🏦 Instead
          of issuing sovereign money, the State chose to borrow from unnamed
          creditors — likely nobles, merchant elites, or foreign banks — without
          ever publishing a full list 🕵️‍♂️. This choice locked Sweden into a
          fiscal model where
          <strong>taxation grew to repay, not to build</strong>, and that logic
          was never reversed 🔁. Today’s income tax, employer contributions and

          consumption tax).

          🧾 <strong>Tax usage:</strong> Approximately
          <strong>60–65%</strong> of that revenue is spent on public services
          (education, health, pensions). Only about <strong>1.37%</strong> goes
          to servicing the public debt — covering interest, not capital.

          🔁 <strong>Debt mechanism:</strong> Sweden does not repay its debt
          like a household would. Instead of paying back the principal, the
          State <u>rolls the debt</u> — borrowing again to refinance maturing
          obligations. As long as market confidence holds, this cycle is
          infinite.

        <p style="line-height: 1.6em">
          🇸🇪 <strong>Debt trend:</strong> Sweden’s public debt dropped from
          <strong>80% of GDP in 1994</strong> to around
          <strong>32% in 2024</strong>.
          <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0"
            >But despite this drop, the overall tax burden remains high</mark
          >, especially on entrepreneurs.
