          <strong>📌 Note — Auditor Appointment Requirement in Sweden</strong>
        </summary>

        <p style="line-height: 1.5">
          Under Swedish law (<em>Årsredovisningslagen</em>), limited companies
          must appoint a statutory auditor if they exceed
          <strong>2 out of 3 thresholds</strong> for
          <u>two consecutive years</u>:
        </p>

        <table style="font-size: 0.9em; margin-bottom: 1em">
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Criterion</th>
              <th>Threshold</th>
              <th>Typical Source</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>Balance sheet total</td>
              <td>> 1.5 MSEK</td>
              <td>Annual report or credit report</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Net turnover</td>
              <td>> 3 MSEK</td>
              <td>Annual report or credit report</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Employees (average)</td>
              <td>> 3</td>

        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
          In the case of <strong>HSSC Event AB</strong>, the 2023 credit report
          shows the following growth trajectory:
        </p>

        <ul style="margin-bottom: 1em">
          <li><strong>2021</strong> → 11.3 MSEK turnover</li>
          <li><strong>2022</strong> → 22.9 MSEK</li>
          <li><strong>2023</strong> → 40.5 MSEK, with <u>21 employees</u></li>
        </ul>

        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
          <strong>🧾 Conclusion</strong> — If the company had >3 employees and
          >3 MSEK in turnover as early as 2020 (likely given the curve), it
          triggered the legal obligation to appoint an auditor by
          <strong>2021</strong>.
        </p>

        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
          Its appointment on <strong>10 May 2021</strong> may reflect a
          <u>late compliance adjustment</u> — a common occurrence among
          fast-scaling private firms. Not a scandal, but a useful forensic
          marker.

      <details id="note-holding-purpose">
        <summary><strong>📎 Note — Role of a Holding Company</strong></summary>
        <p style="line-height: 1.5">
          A <strong>holding company</strong> is a legal structure created to
          <u>own shares in one or more other companies</u>, often without any
          direct operational activity. Its primary purpose is to
          <u>consolidate control and centralize profits</u>, typically through
          the reception of dividends.
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.5">
          In Sweden, this structure is widely used for
          <strong>tax optimization</strong>: profits received by the holding are
          usually tax-exempt, and personal income from dividends can be deferred
          or distributed under more favorable tax brackets (typically
          <strong>20–30%</strong> under the “3:12 rules”).
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.5">
          This setup is <u>legal and common</u>, especially among entrepreneurs
          and founders. However, when combined with
          <em>limited transparency</em>, it can make it harder to identify the
          true financial beneficiaries behind a company’s profits.
        </p>

      <details id="note-property-asset">
        <summary><strong>📎 Note — Property & Asset Manager</strong></summary>

        <p style="line-height: 1.6">
          A <strong>property & asset manager</strong> is a type of company that
          doesn't sell anything or run a daily business. Instead, it's often
          used to
          <span style="background-color: #e5e7eb"
            ><strong>own things</strong> (like real estate or shares)</span
          >
          and <strong>get paid</strong> from them.
        </p>

        <p style="line-height: 1.6">
          For example, some restaurateurs use one company to run the restaurant,
          and
          <span style="background-color: #e5e7eb"
            ><strong>another company to own the building</strong></span
          >
          or receive rent. This setup can also help
          <u><strong>finance a personal apartment</strong></u> or protect family
          property.
        </p>

        <p style="line-height: 1.6">
          It's a <strong>common and legal structure</strong>, especially when
          people want to <u>separate risk and income</u>, or when they want to
          <u>pay themselves differently</u> — not as salary, but through other
          income.

        <summary><strong>📌 Note — What’s an “Invest AB”?</strong></summary>

        <p style="line-height: 1.6em">
          The <strong>“Invest AB”</strong> suffix — short for
          <em>Investment Aktiebolag</em> — doesn’t always imply an active
          investment firm. In Swedish business practice, it often means a
          company used for
          <strong>holding, shielding, or managing income</strong> through a
          separate legal structure.
        </p>

        <p style="line-height: 1.6em">
          The model is popular among restaurateurs and service professionals.
          Instead of drawing a salary (which is taxed at a higher rate), they
          channel earnings into their Invest AB, pay lower corporate tax, and
          later <u>withdraw dividends</u> at favorable rates.
        </p>

        <p style="line-height: 1.6em">
          In Malmö’s hospitality scene, dozens of “Invest AB” entities serve to
          <u>buy family apartments</u>, <u>own restaurant buildings</u>, or
          simply <u>shield liability</u>. It’s a quiet way of
          <span style="background-color: #e5e7eb"
            ><strong
              >separating private control from operational exposure</strong
            ></span
          >.
        </p>

        <p style="line-height: 1.6em">
          This strategy gained traction post-2006 tax reforms in Sweden, and is
          now a common template for service-heavy or risk-prone sectors.

          that <u>pre-registers companies</u> (typically ABs) with
          <em>Bolagsverket</em> and keeps them dormant until purchased. These
          <span class="highlight">off-the-shelf structures</span> come with an

          Most jurisdictions—including Sweden—require commercial websites to
          identify their legal operator. In Sweden, this is enforced by the
          <strong>E-commerce Act (2002:562)</strong>, which mandates clear
          display of the <u>company name, organisation number, VAT ID</u>, and
          contact details.

          Omission of such disclosures is not always illegal, but it typically

          <strong>⚖️ Note — Board Member vs. Effective Owner</strong>
        </summary>

        <p style="line-height: 1.6em">
          In Swedish company law, a
          <strong>board member</strong> (styrelseledamot) is the official legal
          figure associated with governance. But in practice, this role is often
          used to <u>signal legitimacy</u> or
          <span class="highlight">front a corporate structure</span>
          without reflecting who truly controls the business.
        </p>

        <p style="line-height: 1.6em">
          According to <strong>EU Directive 2015/849</strong>, the
          <em>beneficial owner</em> (verklig huvudman) must be disclosed
          separately — typically the person who ultimately owns or controls the
          entity. This aims to
          <span class="highlight">prevent opacity</span> and deter misuse of
          legal facades.
        </p>

        <p style="line-height: 1.6em">
          In sectors like hospitality or nightlife, it’s common to find
          <strong>proxy board members</strong> (e.g. family, accountant,
          long-time friend) while real power is exercised by someone else —
          often due to <u>reputation concerns</u>, past legal trouble, or the
          need to stay out of public documents.
        </p>

        <p style="line-height: 1.6em">
          In the case of <strong>HHSC Event AB</strong>, for instance, Mr.
          Henrik Siebert, widely acknowledged as a key architect of the
          <em>Quan</em> project, does
          <span class="highlight">not appear in any official filing</span>.
          Instead, Saahil Chudasama and Sahar El Nasser are listed, while the
          beneficial owner is Ms. Dahl.
        </p>

        <p style="line-height: 1.6em">
          This discrepancy suggests a
          <strong>protective distancing</strong> strategy:
          <u>separating operational control from legal exposure</u>. In cases
          like these, the board may reflect not power, but <em>cover</em>.

        <p style="line-height: 1.6em">
          In many hospitality ventures,
          <strong>board members listed in legal filings</strong> are not the
          actual initiators or operators. Instead, they often act as
          <u>legal proxies</u> for visibility-sensitive founders, allowing for
          discretion, operational distancing, or reputational shielding.

            >Henrik Siebert’s absence from the board of HSSC Event AB</span
          >, despite his public role in launching Quan, points to a likely
          strategy of <strong>protective distancing</strong>. This setup enables
          the true initiator to
          <u>control strategy and execution from the background</u>, while
          ensuring no formal tie appears in commercial registries.
        </p>

        <p style="line-height: 1.6em">
          In high-end properties—especially those operating under
          <strong>Marriott International</strong> or
          <strong>Elite Hotels of Sweden</strong>—such distancing may even be
          required. Large hotel groups often <u>conduct internal vetting</u> and
          avoid contracting with individuals involved in prior disputes,
          reputational risk, or internal conflicts. This can lead to private
          conditions requiring founders to remain out of legal view, using
          <span class="highlight">“clean” board members</span> as interface.
        </p>

        <p style="line-height: 1.6em">
          While not inherently illegal, this practice blurs the lines between
          <u>ownership, control, and liability</u>. It can be used to obscure
          lines of accountability and delay consequences in case of legal
          disputes, financial mismanagement, or employee claims.
        </p>

        <p style="line-height: 1.6em">
          In Sweden, the 2015 EU directive on money laundering requires
          companies to register a
          <strong>verklig huvudman</strong> (beneficial owner), separate from
          the board, to limit such opacity. Yet in practice,

        <summary><strong>📌 Note – Etagegruppen AB: From Club Etage to Malmö's Nightlife Empire</strong></summary>
        <p style="line-height: 1.6em">
          <strong>Etagegruppen AB</strong> (org. 556402-6697) is a regional hospitality group founded on <strong>July 25, 1990</strong> by <strong>Michael Hagqvist</strong> (21), to operate the Malmö nightclub <strong>Etage</strong>, located at <span class="highlight">Stortorget 6</span>. The venue, originally opened in the 1980s, became one of the largest clubs in the city with <span class="highlight">4 dance floors and a karaoke bar</span>, and has remained an iconic nightlife spot.
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.6em">
          During the 2000s, Etagegruppen expanded its footprint in Malmö with a portfolio including:
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Centiliter & Gram</strong> (created 2007, opened 2008) – a premium cocktail bar (Stortorget 17), popular among the 25+ crowd;</li>
            <li><strong>Goose Bar & Restaurang</strong> (launched 2010) – a casual pub-restaurant near Gustav Adolfs Torg;</li>
            <li><strong>Club operations at Hotel Scandic Crown</strong> – under the names <em>Level</em> (mainstream) and <em>Wonk</em> (LGBT+), active since 2011.</li>
          </ul>
          By 2012, the group simultaneously managed <span class="highlight">Etage, Centiliter & Gram, Goose, and Level/Wonk</span>, employing cross-venue synergies in marketing, ticketing, and HR.
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.6em">
          In <strong>April 2012</strong>, Etagegruppen acquired <strong>Izakaya Koi AB</strong> (556765-3844), absorbing its operational structure but preserving its original name and atmosphere. This marked the closure of the <em>Henrik Siebert era</em> and consolidated Etagegruppen’s control over key nightlife assets in Malmö’s central square.
        </p>

        <p style="line-height: 1.6em">
          Etagegruppen’s reputation remains solid in Malmö’s nightlife scene. In 2013, its parent company posted revenues of <strong>~5.5 million SEK</strong> (excluding subsidiaries), and its venues are regularly featured in nightlife guides. Hagqvist has also acted as a semi-official spokesperson for local business owners, including public opposition to restrictive terrace regulations.

        <p style="line-height: 1.6em">
          In the context of a 4-star hotel like <u>Elite Hotel Esplanade</u>, a <strong>restaurant operated on-site</strong> should follow 
          a transparent, minimal structure. Instead, the setup around <strong>Restaurant Steakhouse Lilla Torg AB</strong> involves at least 
          <span class="highlight">five companies</span> — <u>Tributum AB</u>, <u>Aspiratio Holding AB</u>, <u>HSSC Event AB</u>, <u>Kedah Holding AB</u>, and <u>Chudasama Invest AB</u> — 
          with overlapping control and unclear division of functions.
        </p>
      
        <ul style="line-height: 1.6em">
          <li>📄 <strong>Tributum AB</strong> was used for VAT registration and to employ restaurant staff.</li>
          <li>🏢 <strong>HSSC Event AB</strong> signed the commercial lease with the hotel, acting as legal tenant.</li>
          <li>🧾 <strong>Kedah Holding AB</strong> issued invoices to customers and processed payments, despite having no front-facing role.</li>
          <li>🔒 <strong>Chudasama Invest AB</strong> received dividends and declared capital movement without direct operational involvement.</li>
          <li>💼 <strong>Aspiratio Holding AB</strong> remains <span class="highlight">untraceable in ownership structure</span>, with no beneficial owners listed in the registry.</li>
        </ul>
      
        <p style="line-height: 1.6em">
          A healthy and conventional structure in such a hospitality context would involve:
        </p>
      
        <ul style="line-height: 1.6em">
          <li>✅ <strong>One single operational company</strong> handling all front-of-house and contractual responsibilities.</li>
          <li>✅ Registered VAT and F-skatt directly under the same legal entity.</li>
          <li>✅ Transparent board and <u>declared beneficial ownership</u>.</li>
          <li>✅ Public declaration of <strong>profit distribution</strong> through standard Bolagsverket filings.</li>
        </ul>
      
        <p style="line-height: 1.6em">
          Splitting leases, invoices, and payroll across multiple shell companies in the same space creates operational opacity,
          <strong>limits accountability</strong>, and can be seen as a tactic to <u>compartmentalize risk or obscure liability</u>.
          In a premium hotel environment, this raises red flags for unions, auditors, and brand partners.

        <p style="line-height: 1.6em">
          A <strong>holding company</strong> is a legal entity that owns shares in one or more other companies, typically to control or consolidate their operations. It <u>does not necessarily operate a commercial business</u> of its own. In Sweden, this is often used for:  
        </p>
      
        <ul style="line-height: 1.6em">
          <li>📂 Grouping ownership of multiple subsidiaries under one entity</li>
          <li>💼 Receiving dividends or profit transfers from operating companies</li>
          <li>💰 Facilitating strategic financial operations (e.g., capital injections, risk insulation)</li>
          <li>🧾 Tax structuring — using intercompany loans, transfers, or consolidation of accounts</li>
        </ul>
      
        <p style="line-height: 1.6em">
          While this structure can offer <strong>efficiency and transparency</strong> in large groups (e.g., a restaurant group with multiple brands), it can also be <span class="highlight">misused for opacity</span>, especially when there is:
        </p>
      
        <ul style="line-height: 1.6em">
          <li>❌ No real operational subsidiaries under the holding</li>
          <li>❌ No declared ownership in other companies</li>
          <li>❌ Distributions of profits without a traceable origin of revenue</li>
        </ul>
      
        <p style="line-height: 1.6em"><strong>🔍 Case: Kehda Holding AB</strong></p>

        <p style="line-height: 1.6em">
          This suggests that <strong>Kehda is not functioning as a real holding</strong> under the strict sense of the term.

          <li>✅ It is <u>legal</u> to pay dividends if the company has retained earnings and proper accounting.</li>
          <li>❌ But the declared nature as a "holding" requires economic substance (control of shares, consolidation logic).</li>
          <li>🔍 Without ownership of revenue-generating entities, this structure may be scrutinized as <strong>income shifting or mislabeling</strong> of earnings.</li>
