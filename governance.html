        <h2>Why Authority Mapping Matters for Investment</h2>

        <p>
          Companies fail when
          <strong>nobody actually owns critical decisions</strong>. You can have
          perfect financials, great products, solid market position ‚Äî but if
          authority flows are broken,
          <u
            >value gets destroyed daily through delayed responses, duplicated
            work, and strategic procrastination</u
          >. Traditional Due Diligence misses this completely.
        </p>

        <p>
          I trace decision patterns backwards from
          <strong
            >operational failures to find the actual power structure</strong
          >. Most companies have shadow hierarchies where the person with the
          title isn't the person solving problems. These
          <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0"
            >authority gaps create cash leaks</mark
          >
          that compound over time but never show up in quarterly reports.
        </p>

        <p>
          The method identifies
          <strong
            >social roles, silences, disconnections, and improvisation</strong
          >. It exposes how instructions circulate without structure, and how
          power gets enacted informally. Finding these patterns early means
          knowing exactly where to apply pressure during
          <u>operational restructuring</u>.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Field Research Method</h2>

        <p>
          To understand how authority really flows in small businesses, I worked
          directly in operations for <strong>over 14 months</strong>. This gave
          me ground-level insight into how decisions actually get made versus
          what <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0">org charts claim</mark>.
          You can't detect authority dysfunction from spreadsheets ‚Äî you have to
          watch behavioral patterns under pressure.
        </p>

        <div style="text-align: center; margin: 2rem 0">
          <img
            src="./assets/img/bathroom_wirebin_da_peppe_due_2023.jpg"
            alt="Operational research - backend systems analysis"
            style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 8px"
          />
        </div>

        <p>
          <strong>Direct observation</strong> reveals gaps between formal
          procedures and actual workflow that financial statements never
          capture. I documented
          <u>who people actually call when something breaks</u>, whose approval
          is really needed for decisions, and
          <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0"
            >which processes consistently create bottlenecks</mark
          >
          regardless of what the manual says.
        </p>

        <p>
          This isn't academic research ‚Äî it's
          <strong>pattern library development for practical application</strong
          >. Each operational environment teaches you to recognize recurring
          dysfunction types faster. The goal is building
          <u>rapid assessment capability</u> for investment decisions where
          authority clarity determines value preservation or destruction.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Authority Dysfunction Patterns</h2>

        <p>
          Most authority problems fall into
          <strong>three predictable categories</strong>. First,
          <u>proxy authority</u> ‚Äî where someone without formal power makes all
          the real decisions through influence or necessity. Second,
          <strong>responsibility gaps</strong> where critical decisions belong
          to nobody and everything stalls. Third,
          <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0">shadow governance</mark> where
          unofficial hierarchies contradict formal structures.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Proxy authority</strong> often emerges when founders or key
          operators maintain informal control after delegating formal
          responsibility. Employees learn to bypass official channels because
          <u>the real decision-maker</u> isn't the person with the title. This
          creates efficiency in the short term but massive confusion during
          transitions or scaling.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Responsibility gaps</strong> happen when authority gets
          distributed without clear ownership boundaries. Multiple people can
          say no to decisions but nobody can say yes without checking with
          someone else. These gaps multiply during stress and
          <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0"
            >paralyze response capability</mark
          >
          exactly when quick decisions matter most.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Investment Application Framework</h2>

        <p>
          I map three authority layers during company analysis:
          <strong>formal authority</strong> (what documents say),
          <strong>operational authority</strong> (who people actually call), and
          <u>crisis authority</u> (who shows up when everything breaks). The
          gaps between these three layers predict exactly where value is being
          destroyed.
        </p>

        <p>
          Companies with <strong>clean authority alignment</strong> across all
          three layers operate efficiently and scale predictably. Companies with
          major gaps burn cash through
          <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0"
            >decision delays, role confusion, and duplicated effort</mark
          >. The fix is usually simple authority redistribution, but you have to
          see the pattern first.
        </p>

        <p>
          This analysis works particularly well for
          <strong>acquisition targets</strong> where operational improvements
          can unlock immediate value. Most buyers focus on revenue growth
          projections when the bigger opportunity is
          <u>eliminating authority dysfunction</u> that's constraining existing
          operations. Fix decision flow and everything else becomes easier.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Shadow Governance Detection</h2>

        <p>
          <strong>Shadow governance</strong> refers to informal or hidden
          control where real decisions get made by individuals who aren't
          officially listed as board members, shareholders, or legal
          signatories. These actors exert power through personal ties, financial
          leverage, or
          <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0"
            >influence over day-to-day operations</mark
          >
          without leaving legal traces in public records.
        </p>

        <p>
          I identify shadow governance by tracking
          <strong
            >decision patterns, resource allocation, and communication
            flows</strong
          >. Who gets consulted before major choices? Whose opinion consistently
          shapes strategy?
          <u
            >Which relationships determine hiring, firing, and budget
            approval</u
          >? The answers rarely match the org chart but always predict
          operational behavior.
        </p>

        <p>
          Shadow governance isn't necessarily problematic ‚Äî many successful
          companies operate with informal authority structures that work well.
          The issue arises during
          <strong>transitions, scaling, or integration</strong> when hidden
          dependencies create unexpected bottlenecks. Mapping these structures
          early prevents
          <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0"
            >value destruction during ownership changes</mark
          >.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Practical Due Diligence Integration</h2>

        <p>
          Traditional Due Diligence focuses on
          <strong>financials, legal structure, and market position</strong> but
          ignores operational authority patterns. I integrate authority mapping
          into investment analysis by interviewing employees at different
          levels, observing <u>communication patterns</u>, and tracking how
          decisions actually flow during normal operations.
        </p>

        <p>
          The process reveals <strong>operational leverage points</strong> where
          small authority clarifications create disproportionate efficiency
          gains. It also identifies
          <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0">integration risks</mark> where
          informal power structures might resist change or create hidden
          dependencies that complicate management transitions.
        </p>

        <p>
          This isn't about finding problems to negotiate down price ‚Äî it's about
          <strong>identifying specific value creation opportunities</strong>
          through organizational optimization. Most operational improvements
          require authority clarification before implementation. Understanding
          the actual power structure means knowing exactly which interventions
          will work and which will fail.
