  <section class="narrative-intro">
  
        <p>
          This part completes the <em>narrative grid</em> — by focusing on how
          authority was distributed, claimed, or blurred throughout the
          workplace conflict.
        </p>
        <details>
          <summary class="section-order">
            🕸️ <strong>Part 3 — Authority Mapping</strong>
          </summary>

          <p>
            <strong>Function:</strong> To trace how decisions were made,
            delegated, or avoided — and how visible and invisible roles shaped
            the workplace structure.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Fields:</strong> This method appears in
            <a href="/glossary.html#authority-mapping">authority mapping</a>
            (audit),
            <a href="/glossary.html#governance-review">governance reviews</a>,
            and
            <a href="/glossary.html#decision-tracing">decision tracing</a> in
            management and legal investigations.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Usage:</strong> These tools are used to detect
            <strong>proxy authority</strong>,
            <strong>responsibility gaps</strong>, and
            <strong>unspoken hierarchies</strong> — especially where formal
            titles mask operational control.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Adaptation:</strong> This section identifies
            <strong>social roles</strong>, <strong>silences</strong>,
            <strong>disconnections</strong>, and <strong>improvisation</strong>.
            It exposes how instructions circulated without structure, and how
            power was enacted informally.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Structure:</strong> The narrative isolates key moments of
            implied authority. It focuses on contrasts — between who was legally
            in charge, and who shaped the team’s behavior in practice.

        <h2><mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0">Founder Figure</mark></h2>
        <p>
          My father (77) was an <strong>independent</strong> concrete truck
          driver. He worked
          <strong>relentlessly</strong>, chasing
          <strong>social status</strong> as a kind of <em>protective halo</em>.
          Likely driven by an <strong>internalized pressure</strong> to avoid
          returning as an <em>unsuccessful immigrant</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
          He raised me alone. I never knew my mother. We never spoke about her —
          or anything else.
          <strong>He was locked in mutism.</strong> I learned to read
          <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0">rationed speech</mark> not as
          <strong>wisdom</strong> or <strong>maturity</strong>, but as
          <strong>manipulation</strong>,
          <span style="text-decoration: underline">lies by omission</span>, or
          <em>internal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_alienation" class="subtle-link">alienation</a></em>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our task was to <strong>tackle every critical problem</strong> in our
          way , so everything could run by Monday.
          <u>Silence replaced parenting</u>; he worked
          <strong>methodically, analytically</strong>, unfolding each solution
          <strong>in sequence</strong>. Even at meals, it was clear he was
          <u>mapping execution plans in his head</u>.
        </p>

<p>
I lived <strong>systemic alienation by proxy</strong>, 
as the job turned my father into a
 <strong>high-functioning automaton</strong>. At 16
, I walked away — 
<mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0">rejecting the self-made man myth entirely</mark>. 
I only looked back once, at 27, just to make sure I wasnt wrong.

        </h2>

        <p>
          I met <strong>my best and only friend</strong> during my final year of
          high school. <strong>Samuel</strong> (46) came from a
          <u>bourgeois Jewish family</u>, and in his field, men like him were
          called <strong>“lenders”</strong> — shorthand for credit-leasing. He
          showed up with cash when liquidity was tight. His car was his office.
        </p>

        <p>
          He spoke constantly about <strong>balance sheets</strong>,
          <strong>client types</strong>, and what made a “perfect financial.”
          His deals targeted firms with pristine numbers — he knew how to read
          them. I listened out of loyalty, never envy; the whole thing felt
          <span class="highlight">morally grey, borderline crooked</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          At <span class="highlight">35</span>, he launched his own firm — same
          model as the financing outfit where he trained, a kind of private
          lender. One of his former bosses would later go to prison. For five
          years, it thrived — then came
          <strong>seminars, alcohol, cocaine, burnout, lawsuits</strong>. I’d
          already walked away.

        <p>
          In <u>late 2023</u>, I joined the

            >“Mussé”</a
          >
          (65) at Stockholm Central Station. He also ran a
          <a href="https://ramblastapas.se" class="subtle-link">tapas bar</a>.
          Yet he was always <strong>on-site</strong> — in his
          <u>small back office</u> or <strong>directly on the floor</strong>.
          <span class="highlight"
            >Most of the team had been there nearly 10 years.</span
          >
        </p>

        <p>
          He’d <strong>varnish tables</strong>, <u>reset the dishwasher</u>, fix
          plumbing, or jump in unprompted. Sometimes he’d
          <a href="#" class="subtle-link">take over the station himself</a> —
          subbing as <u>waiter</u> or <strong>pizzaiolo</strong>, with no ego.
        </p>

        <p>
          Even as a <u>dishwasher</u>, I could call him. He’d appear — no delay.
          No hierarchy, no commands.
          <strong>He moved like staff, not like a boss</strong> — alert,
          reactive, committed.

        <h2>Cofounding Teams</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>At 38</strong>, after years of backpacking and drifting
          between underpaid tech jobs, I returned to <u>Paris</u> and discovered
          the startup world. For the first time, a professional path
          <span class="highlight">felt both honest and exciting</span>: a way
          out of inherited pressure, without scams or self-sacrifice.
        </p>

        <p>
          The ecosystem promised <strong>high output, then escape</strong> — not
          a lifelong sentence. I could work like an athlete for 3 to 5 years,
          then <u>exit the system with dignity</u>. That fantasy matched both my
          tech past and my deeper need for
          <span class="highlight">freedom without deceit</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          I quickly framed the whole thing like an acquirer would.
          <strong>Execution and team</strong> were the only real levers. I
          wanted to be the <strong>technical cofounder</strong> — not a
          spokesperson, not a figurehead. What mattered was to
          <u>ship real features fast</u> and <u>pick the right partner</u>.
          Everything else was noise.

            I joined the project as the developer—older, disconnected, and

            >, financed through a mix of <u>green public subsidies</u> and
            <u>consumer loans</u> generating indirect revenue streams.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong> Structure & Roles:</strong> I was to become
            <u>president of the SAS</u>. Maggie would act as a commercial agent.
            I would manage operations, legal responsibilities, and business
            development, while Samuel remained off the radar, for legal and
            personal reasons.

          <p></p>
          <p>
            <strong>🔺 Red Flags:</strong> Samuel was never able to articulate a
            <strong>clear value proposition</strong>, despite repeated requests.
            The model relied on a
            <u>network of brokers and subcontractors</u> to circulate deals,
            bypass ownership risk, and extract public liquidity without
            oversight.
          </p>

          <p>
            Meggie never <strong>introduced herself</strong> or made any effort
            to engage.
            <u>Her focus was split between children and personal calls</u>, even
            during key discussions. The project was only mentioned in
            <mark style="background-color: #ccc"
              >festive or distracted settings</mark

            >
            describes exactly this setup: a legal façade used to collect
            subsidies and circulate funds with no operational basis.
          </p>

          <p>
            The company functioned as a
            <a
              href="https://www.village-justice.com/articles/critere-classification-des,16989.html"

              ><strong>affectio societatis</strong></a

            was entirely absent. In practice, it functioned more as a formal
            shell than a genuine collaborative venture.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Break Point:</strong> I realized within days there was
            <mark style="background-color: #ccc"
              >no project, no structure, no trust</mark
            >. Everything was driven by inertia and opacity. I declined to take
            the presidency and left before signing anything official.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Aftermath:</strong> The company was
            <u>officially liquidated in 2022</u>. Both founders have since

          <p>
            <strong>Value Proposition:</strong> My partner at the time, a single
            mother on severance pay, asked to join a consumer review web app I
            was prototyping.
          </p>
          <p>
            We rented a shared office and started strong. But her availability,
            emotional bandwidth, and communication style weren’t compatible with
            the demands of a startup. We hit friction. She shut down. The
            project ended.

          <strong>Lesson:</strong>
          Founders must resolve ambiguity. Energy and enthusiasm aren't enough.
          Alignment, honesty, and clarity are non-negotiable.

        <h2>Co-founder ambiguity and early red flags</h2>
        <p>
          When I joined the team, no one introduced themselves as
          <strong>the founder</strong>. Henrik acted as the owner, but
          <u>Sahar</u> was the sole visible authority. I kept asking myself:
          <span class="highlight">who’s actually in charge?</span> No title, no
          presence, no clear anchor.
        </p>
        <p>
          At first, I assumed she was just another manager. But she answered
          questions Henrik avoided. She was sharp, brief, and firm. No warmth.
          No background story. She appeared out of nowhere, but
          <strong>nothing moved without her</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Over the years, I’d worked in
          <strong>44 companies across 6 countries</strong> — always in the
          shadows, always under pressure. Kitchens, warehouses, call centers,
          software teams. I’d seen every management flavor — tough, chaotic,
          absent, cynical.
        </p>
        <p>
          But <span class="highlight">never hostile, never immature</span>. What
          I saw at Quan, through Sahar, had no precedent. The coldness wasn’t
          cultural — it felt calculated. And it showed up instantly, without
          background, without buildup.
        </p>

        <h2>Patterns I’ve seen before</h2>
        <p>
          I’d been through
          <strong>three failed co-founder stories</strong> before joining QUAN.
          Each time, the breakdown came from the same ingredients:
          <u>blurred ownership</u>, <u>mismatched presence</u>, and
          <u>unspoken hierarchy</u>.
        </p>
        <p>
          One founder has the energy, the other holds the veto. One builds trust
          with the team, the other stays silent but controls the money. These
          setups <span class="highlight">always implode</span>.
        </p>

        <h2>The founder vacuum at QUAN</h2>
        <p>
          Henrik was there every day — visible, engaged, occasionally playful.
          But every critical call — contracts, suppliers, layout — was filtered
          through Sahar. Staff saw her rarely, but feared her judgement. She
          <strong>hovered</strong> over the structure, undefined but decisive.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even as I built trust with the kitchen crew, I sensed the real power
          didn’t sit in the restaurant. It sat somewhere <u>adjacent</u>,
          unnamed. The entire hierarchy floated on ambiguity.
        </p>

        <h2>Why this matters</h2>
        <p>
          In every startup, <strong>founder alignment isn’t optional</strong>.
          It’s oxygen. When one co-founder avoids exposure, while the other
          plays the frontman, the team gets confused. Loyalty dilutes. Authority
          becomes performative.
        </p>
        <p>
          It’s not a branding problem — it’s an
          <strong>operational fragility</strong>. And eventually, someone pays
          the price.

          These three experiences shaped my understanding of what it means to
          build something with someone.

      <p>
        The ambiguity in responsibility at the heart of Quan’s management —
        marked by <strong>avoidance</strong>, <strong>blurred roles</strong>,
        and a <strong>lack of steady accountability</strong> — struck me the
        most. It naturally led to an archaeology of how this scaffolding was
        laid.
      </p>

      <p>
        When I first considered applying at Quan, I conducted a standard
        ownership check to tailor my motivation email.
        <strong
          >Henrik Kei Siebert was the only visible public figure linked to the
          restaurant</strong
        >, repeatedly cited in hotel communications and online articles as its
        founder.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong
          >No trace of a distinct legal entity operating Quan appeared in public
          records</strong
        >, which left me uncertain about whom to address—and forced me to send a
        generic, unpersonalized message.
      </p>

      <p>
        My job interview had been conducted by a woman who introduced herself as
        <strong>Sahar</strong>—"like Sahara", she said. Only later, by
        cross-checking the name in Personalkollen, did I understand she held a
        formal role within <strong>HSSC Event AB</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Despite this, <strong>Henrik Kei Siebert</strong>—the only visible
        public figure associated with Quan—did not appear anywhere in official
        records. His absence from the company’s registration was surprising,
        given his public role and occasional presence on site.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>According to the Swedish Beneficial Ownership Register</strong>,
        HSSC Event AB is controlled by KEHDA Holding AB, through which Lin
        Daniella Dahl holds between 50–75% of the shares. Her name is absent
        from operational documents and restaurant-facing materials.
      </p>

      <p>
        The domain <strong>quanbyquan.se</strong>, which has hosted Quan’s
        website since 2018, was registered on <strong>24 August 2018</strong>.
        WHOIS data discloses no owner identity, and the site contains no
        <em>impressum</em> or corporate details.
      </p>

      <p>
        Throughout my three weeks of employment at Quan,
        <strong>Saahil Chudasama</strong>—officially listed as a co-owner—was
        <strong>never seen on-site</strong>. No colleague ever mentioned him,
        and his name played no role in daily operations.
      </p>

      (2018–2024) confirm none of these elements ever appeared on the site.

      <p>
        Henrik’s role appeared
        <strong>detached from the daily team flow</strong>. I never witnessed
        him share a joke, give a directive, or interact casually with staff.
        From my position in the back kitchen, he always seemed removed, even
        when physically present.
      </p>
      <p>
        By contrast,
        <strong>Sahar was visibly active in team coordination</strong>. I saw
        her engage directly with the floor manager, the head chef, and multiple
        sous-chefs—often inside the kitchen. She also managed interviews and
        subcontractor issues. There was no doubt she operated at the core of
        daily operations.

          📌 Structural Note: Informal Leadership, Formal Incorporation
        </summary>
        <br />

        No internal communication or shared leadership structure was visible
        during the <strong>observed period</strong>. Staff routines followed
        <strong>practical rather than hierarchical logic</strong>, with no
        direct managerial access linked to the
        <strong>two registered owners</strong>.<br /><br />

        This model coexisted with
        <strong>remarkable financial output</strong>—reportedly over 5 million
        SEK in net profit in 2023, and
        <strong>3 weeks of advance booking</strong> at all times. The later
        registration of <em>Tributum AB</em> may indicate a step toward
        structural consolidation or <em>structural clarity</em>.
      </details>

      <p>
        Tributum AB officially declared a business activity of
        <strong>restaurant operations (restaurangverksamhet)</strong>. Its board
        includes <strong>Henrik Kei Siebert</strong> as CEO,
        <strong>Sahar El Nasser</strong> as board member, and
        <strong>Lin Daniella Dahl</strong> as deputy. This configuration mirrors
        operational roles already observed at Quan.
      </p>

      <p>
        This synchronised registration raises strategic questions. While
        <em>Tributum AB</em> was presented as a formal clarification of
        restaurant activity, <em>Aspiratio</em> could serve as a
        <em>holding or fallback structure</em>, or as a shielded platform
        disconnected from declared payroll operations.

          📌 Structural Insight: Dual Entities, Silent Repositioning
        </summary>

        <p>
          The mirrored setup of <strong>Tributum AB</strong> and
          <strong>Aspiratio Holding AB</strong>, both created on July 1st at the
          same address, goes beyond <strong>administrative convenience</strong>.
          Their design suggests an attempt to
          <strong>redistribute roles</strong>,
          <strong>separate exposures</strong>, and
          <strong>clarify legal responsibility</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          While Tributum declared active restaurant operations,
          <strong>Aspiratio remains structurally dormant</strong>: no payroll,
          no declared business. This silent setup may offer
          <strong>future flexibility</strong>,
          <strong>discreet compensation flows</strong>, or
          <strong>risk management</strong> beyond the main operation.
        </p>
        <p>
          This dual setup could act as a <strong>buffer</strong>—absorbing
          pressure, shielding liability, or preparing for change—without public
          disclosure or fiscal trace.
        </p>

        <p>
          Despite being officially registered only as a
          <em>suppleant</em> (alternate board member), her signature confirms an
          <strong>operational role in human resources</strong>. It also implies
          her position as the primary interface with
          <strong>external entities such as HRAK</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Separately, the <strong>employment certificate</strong> issued in my
          name was <strong>signed by Sahar El Nasser</strong>. This formal act
          establishes her involvement in administrative and personnel matters,
          beyond her nominal board position.
