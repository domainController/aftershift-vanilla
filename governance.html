      <h1>Operational Authority</h1>
  <section class="narrative-intro">
        <p>
          This part completes the <em>narrative grid</em> ‚Äî by focusing on how
          authority was distributed, claimed, or blurred throughout the
          workplace conflict.

            üï∏Ô∏è <strong>Part 3 ‚Äî Authority Mapping</strong>
          </summary>

          <p>
            <strong>Function:</strong> To trace how decisions were made,
            delegated, or avoided ‚Äî and how visible and invisible roles shaped
            the workplace structure.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Fields:</strong> This method appears in
            <a href="/glossary.html#authority-mapping">authority mapping</a>
            (audit),
            <a href="/glossary.html#governance-review">governance reviews</a>,

            <strong>Usage:</strong> These tools are used to detect
            <strong>proxy authority</strong>,
            <strong>responsibility gaps</strong>, and
            <strong>unspoken hierarchies</strong> ‚Äî especially where formal
            titles mask operational control.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Adaptation:</strong> This section identifies
            <strong>social roles</strong>, <strong>silences</strong>,
            <strong>disconnections</strong>, and <strong>improvisation</strong>.
            It exposes how instructions circulated without structure, and how
            power was enacted informally.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Structure:</strong> The narrative isolates key moments of
            implied authority. It focuses on contrasts ‚Äî between who was legally
            in charge, and who shaped the team‚Äôs behavior in practice.

      <p>
        The ambiguity in responsibility at the heart of Quan‚Äôs management ‚Äî
        marked by <strong>avoidance</strong>, <strong>blurred roles</strong>,
        and a <strong>lack of steady accountability</strong> ‚Äî struck me the
        most. It naturally led to an archaeology of how this scaffolding was
        laid.
      </p>

      <p>
        When I first considered applying at Quan, I conducted a standard
        ownership check to tailor my motivation email.
        <strong
          >Henrik Kei Siebert was the only visible public figure linked to the
          restaurant</strong
        >, repeatedly cited in hotel communications and online articles as its
        founder.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong
          >No trace of a distinct legal entity operating Quan appeared in public
          records</strong
        >, which left me uncertain about whom to address‚Äîand forced me to send a
        generic, unpersonalized message.
      </p>

      <p>
        My job interview had been conducted by a woman who introduced herself as
        <strong>Sahar</strong>‚Äî"like Sahara", she said. Only later, by
        cross-checking the name in Personalkollen, did I understand she held a
        formal role within <strong>HSSC Event AB</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Despite this, <strong>Henrik Kei Siebert</strong>‚Äîthe only visible
        public figure associated with Quan‚Äîdid not appear anywhere in official
        records. His absence from the company‚Äôs registration was surprising,
        given his public role and occasional presence on site.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>According to the Swedish Beneficial Ownership Register</strong>,
        HSSC Event AB is controlled by KEHDA Holding AB, through which Lin
        Daniella Dahl holds between 50‚Äì75% of the shares. Her name is absent
        from operational documents and restaurant-facing materials.
      </p>

      <p>
        The domain <strong>quanbyquan.se</strong>, which has hosted Quan‚Äôs
        website since 2018, was registered on <strong>24 August 2018</strong>.
        WHOIS data discloses no owner identity, and the site contains no
        <em>impressum</em> or corporate details.
      </p>

      <p>
        Throughout my three weeks of employment at Quan,
        <strong>Saahil Chudasama</strong>‚Äîofficially listed as a co-owner‚Äîwas
        <strong>never seen on-site</strong>. No colleague ever mentioned him,
        and his name played no role in daily operations.
      </p>


        (2018‚Äì2024) confirm none of these elements ever appeared on the site.
      </p>

      <p>
        Henrik‚Äôs role appeared
        <strong>detached from the daily team flow</strong>. I never witnessed
        him share a joke, give a directive, or interact casually with staff.
        From my position in the back kitchen, he always seemed removed, even
        when physically present.
      </p>
      <p>
        By contrast,
        <strong>Sahar was visibly active in team coordination</strong>. I saw
        her engage directly with the floor manager, the head chef, and multiple
        sous-chefs‚Äîoften inside the kitchen. She also managed interviews and
        subcontractor issues. There was no doubt she operated at the core of
        daily operations.

        üìå Structural Note: Informal Leadership, Formal Incorporation
      </summary>
      <br />

      No internal communication or shared leadership structure was visible
      during the <strong>observed period</strong>. Staff routines followed
      <strong>practical rather than hierarchical logic</strong>, with no
      direct managerial access linked to the
      <strong>two registered owners</strong>.<br /><br />

      This model coexisted with
      <strong>remarkable financial output</strong>‚Äîreportedly over 5 million
      SEK in net profit in 2023, and
      <strong>3 weeks of advance booking</strong> at all times. The later
      registration of <em>Tributum AB</em> may indicate a step toward
      structural consolidation or <em>structural clarity</em>.
    </details>


    <p>
      Tributum AB officially declared a business activity of
      <strong>restaurant operations (restaurangverksamhet)</strong>. Its board
      includes <strong>Henrik Kei Siebert</strong> as CEO,
      <strong>Sahar El Nasser</strong> as board member, and
      <strong>Lin Daniella Dahl</strong> as deputy. This configuration mirrors
      operational roles already observed at Quan.
    </p>

    <p>
      This synchronised registration raises strategic questions. While
      <em>Tributum AB</em> was presented as a formal clarification of
      restaurant activity, <em>Aspiratio</em> could serve as a
      <em>holding or fallback structure</em>, or as a shielded platform
      disconnected from declared payroll operations.

      üìå Structural Insight: Dual Entities, Silent Repositioning
    </summary>

    <p>
      The mirrored setup of <strong>Tributum AB</strong> and
      <strong>Aspiratio Holding AB</strong>, both created on July 1st at the
      same address, goes beyond <strong>administrative convenience</strong>.
      Their design suggests an attempt to
      <strong>redistribute roles</strong>,
      <strong>separate exposures</strong>, and
      <strong>clarify legal responsibility</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      While Tributum declared active restaurant operations,
      <strong>Aspiratio remains structurally dormant</strong>: no payroll,
      no declared business. This silent setup may offer
      <strong>future flexibility</strong>,
      <strong>discreet compensation flows</strong>, or
      <strong>risk management</strong> beyond the main operation.
    </p>
    <p>
      This dual setup could act as a <strong>buffer</strong>‚Äîabsorbing
      pressure, shielding liability, or preparing for change‚Äîwithout public
      disclosure or fiscal trace.
    </p>

    <p>
      Despite being officially registered only as a
      <em>suppleant</em> (alternate board member), her signature confirms an
      <strong>operational role in human resources</strong>. It also implies
      her position as the primary interface with
      <strong>external entities such as HRAK</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Separately, the <strong>employment certificate</strong> issued in my
      name was <strong>signed by Sahar El Nasser</strong>. This formal act
      establishes her involvement in administrative and personnel matters,
      beyond her nominal board position.
