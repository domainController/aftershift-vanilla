  <section class="narrative-intro">
  
        <p>
          This part completes the <em>narrative grid</em> ‚Äî by focusing on how
          authority was distributed, claimed, or blurred throughout the
          workplace conflict.

          <summary class="section-order">
            üï∏Ô∏è <strong>Part 3 ‚Äî Authority Mapping</strong>
          </summary>

          <p>
            <strong>Function:</strong> To trace how decisions were made,
            delegated, or avoided ‚Äî and how visible and invisible roles shaped
            the workplace structure.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Fields:</strong> This method appears in
            <a href="/glossary.html#authority-mapping">authority mapping</a>
            (audit),
            <a href="/glossary.html#governance-review">governance reviews</a>,

            <a href="/glossary.html#decision-tracing">decision tracing</a> in
            management and legal investigations.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Usage:</strong> These tools are used to detect
            <strong>proxy authority</strong>,
            <strong>responsibility gaps</strong>, and
            <strong>unspoken hierarchies</strong> ‚Äî especially where formal
            titles mask operational control.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Adaptation:</strong> This section identifies
            <strong>social roles</strong>, <strong>silences</strong>,
            <strong>disconnections</strong>, and <strong>improvisation</strong>.
            It exposes how instructions circulated without structure, and how
            power was enacted informally.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Structure:</strong> The narrative isolates key moments of
            implied authority. It focuses on contrasts ‚Äî between who was legally
            in charge, and who shaped the team‚Äôs behavior in practice.

        <h2>Founder Figure</h2>
        <p>
          My father (<u>77</u>) was <strong>self-employed</strong>, an
          <strong>entrepreneur without leverage</strong>, driving his own
          concrete truck ‚Äî at one point, two ‚Äî and briefly hiring a second
          driver. He worked <strong>relentlessly</strong>, chasing
          <strong>social status</strong> as a <u>protective halo</u>. And with
          the pressure to return as a <u>successful immigrant</u>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our task was to <strong>tackle every critical problem</strong> in our
          way , so everything could run by Monday.
          <u>Silence replaced parenting</u>; he worked
          <strong>methodically, analytically</strong>, unfolding each solution
          <strong>in sequence</strong>. Even at meals, it was clear he was
          <u>mapping execution plans in his head</u>.
        </p>

        <p>
          I lived <strong>systemic alienation by proxy</strong>, as the job
          turned my father into a <strong>high-functioning automaton</strong>. I
          had no childhood ‚Äî only proximity to <u>relentless duty</u>.
          <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0">At 16, I walked away</mark>.
          <em> ‚Äî rejecting ambition</em>, seeking
          <strong>personal integrity</strong>. I never really looked back.

        <h2>Entrepreneur Prototype</h2>

        <p>
          I met <strong>my best and only friend</strong> during my final year of
          high school. <strong>Samuel</strong> (46) came from a
          <u>bourgeois Jewish family</u>, and in his field, men like him were
          called <strong>‚Äúlenders‚Äù</strong> ‚Äî shorthand for credit-leasing. He
          showed up with cash when liquidity was tight. His car was his office.
        </p>

        <p>
          He spoke constantly about <strong>balance sheets</strong>,
          <strong>client types</strong>, and what made a ‚Äúperfect financial.‚Äù
          His deals targeted firms with pristine numbers ‚Äî he knew how to read
          them. I listened out of loyalty, never envy; the whole thing felt
          <span class="highlight">morally grey, borderline crooked</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          At <span class="highlight">35</span>, he launched his own firm ‚Äî same
          model as the financing outfit where he trained, a kind of private
          lender. One of his former bosses would later go to prison. For five
          years, it thrived ‚Äî then came
          <strong>seminars, alcohol, cocaine, burnout, lawsuits</strong>. I‚Äôd
          already walked away.

        <h2>Restaurateur Archetype</h2>
        <p>
          In <u>late 2023</u>, I joined the
          <a href="https://dapeppedue.se/" class="subtle-link">pizzeria</a> run
          by
          <a
            href="https://www.allabolag.se/befattning/muzaffer-korkmaz/-/10557570"
            class="subtle-link"
            >‚ÄúMuss√©‚Äù</a
          >
          (65), a Stockholm-based restaurateur with six companies and full
          ownership of two restaurants, including a
          <a href="https://ramblastapas.se" class="subtle-link">tapas bar</a>
          downtown. He was on-site two-thirds of the time ‚Äî either in his office
          or directly on the floor.
        </p>

        <p>
          What stood out was his role as
          <strong>on-site problem solver</strong>. He varnished tables, fixed
          plumbing, and repaired everything from the dishwasher to the fridge.
          He‚Äôd ask if I needed help ‚Äî and a few times
          <u>took over the station himself</u>. He subbed in as waiter, or
          pizza√Øolo ‚Äî no ego, no distance.
        </p>

        <p>
          Even as a <u>dishwasher</u>, the lowest-ranked job, I could call him
          and he‚Äôd show up ‚Äî no delay. He never asked who gave the order. Anyone
          ‚Äî cook, runner, waiter ‚Äî could point, and he‚Äôd act. In the kitchen,
          <strong>he moved like staff, not like a boss</strong> ‚Äî always alert
          to the smallest breakdown.
        </p>

        <h2>Cofounding Teams</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>At 38</strong>, after years of backpacking and drifting
          between underpaid tech jobs, I returned to <u>Paris</u> and discovered
          the startup world. For the first time, a professional path
          <span class="highlight">felt both honest and exciting</span>: a way
          out of inherited pressure, without scams or self-sacrifice.
        </p>

        <p>
          The ecosystem promised <strong>high output, then escape</strong> ‚Äî not
          a lifelong sentence. I could work like an athlete for 3 to 5 years,
          then <u>exit the system with dignity</u>. That fantasy matched both my
          tech past and my deeper need for
          <span class="highlight">freedom without deceit</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          I quickly framed the whole thing like an acquirer would.
          <strong>Execution and team</strong> were the only real levers. I
          wanted to be the <strong>technical cofounder</strong> ‚Äî not a
          spokesperson, not a figurehead. What mattered was to
          <u>ship real features fast</u> and <u>pick the right partner</u>.
          Everything else was noise.

          <p>
            <strong> Structure & Roles:</strong> I was to become
            <u>president of the SAS</u>. Maggie would act as a commercial agent.
            I would manage operations, legal responsibilities, and business
            development, while Samuel remained off the radar, for legal and
            personal reasons.
          </p>

          <p></p>
          <p>
            üö© <strong>Red Flags: </strong> Samuel was never able to articulate
            a <strong>clear value proposition</strong>, despite repeated
            requests. <u>No defined product</u>, <u>no target audience</u>,
            <mark style="background-color: #ccc">no market logic</mark>‚Äîjust
            vague talk of network and financial upside.

          <p>
            Meggie never <strong>introduced herself</strong> or made any effort
            to engage.
            <u>Her focus was split between children and personal calls</u>, even
            during key discussions. The project was only mentioned in

          <p>
            <strong> üí∞ Financial Mechanics:</strong> Each loan issued to
            clients likely triggered <u>commissions from the bank</u>, in
            addition to state-backed installation incentives. The company relied
            on a <u>network of business brokers and subcontractors</u> to
            circulate deals and extract liquidity.

            The company functioned as a

            <strong>Aftermath:</strong> The company was

          <h2>2023‚Äì24 Justisse</h2>
          <p><strong>Founding Team:</strong> Sara & Patrice</p>

          <p>
            <strong>Value Proposition:</strong> My partner at the time, a single
            mother on severance pay, asked to join a consumer review web app I
            was prototyping.
          </p>
          <p>
            We rented a shared office and started strong. But her availability,
            emotional bandwidth, and communication style weren‚Äôt compatible with
            the demands of a startup. We hit friction. She shut down. The
            project ended.
          </p>

          <strong>Lesson:</strong>
          Founders must resolve ambiguity. Energy and enthusiasm aren't enough.
          Alignment, honesty, and clarity are non-negotiable.

        <h2>Co-founder ambiguity and early red flags</h2>
        <p>
          When I joined the team, no one introduced themselves as
          <strong>the founder</strong>. Henrik acted as the owner, but
          <u>Sahar</u> was the sole visible authority. I kept asking myself:
          <span class="highlight">who‚Äôs actually in charge?</span> No title, no
          presence, no clear anchor.
        </p>
        <p>
          At first, I assumed she was just another manager. But she answered
          questions Henrik avoided. She was sharp, brief, and firm. No warmth.
          No background story. She appeared out of nowhere, but
          <strong>nothing moved without her</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Over the years, I‚Äôd worked in
          <strong>44 companies across 6 countries</strong> ‚Äî always in the
          shadows, always under pressure. Kitchens, warehouses, call centers,
          software teams. I‚Äôd seen every management flavor ‚Äî tough, chaotic,
          absent, cynical.
        </p>
        <p>
          But <span class="highlight">never hostile, never immature</span>. What
          I saw at Quan, through Sahar, had no precedent. The coldness wasn‚Äôt
          cultural ‚Äî it felt calculated. And it showed up instantly, without
          background, without buildup.
        </p>

        <h2>Patterns I‚Äôve seen before</h2>

          I‚Äôd been through
          <strong>three failed co-founder stories</strong> before joining QUAN.
          Each time, the breakdown came from the same ingredients:
          <u>blurred ownership</u>, <u>mismatched presence</u>, and
          <u>unspoken hierarchy</u>.
        </p>
        <p>
          One founder has the energy, the other holds the veto. One builds trust
          with the team, the other stays silent but controls the money. These
          setups <span class="highlight">always implode</span>.
        </p>

        <h2>The founder vacuum at QUAN</h2>
        <p>
          Henrik was there every day ‚Äî visible, engaged, occasionally playful.
          But every critical call ‚Äî contracts, suppliers, layout ‚Äî was filtered
          through Sahar. Staff saw her rarely, but feared her judgement. She
          <strong>hovered</strong> over the structure, undefined but decisive.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even as I built trust with the kitchen crew, I sensed the real power
          didn‚Äôt sit in the restaurant. It sat somewhere <u>adjacent</u>,
          unnamed. The entire hierarchy floated on ambiguity.
        </p>

        <h2>Why this matters</h2>
        <p>
          In every startup, <strong>founder alignment isn‚Äôt optional</strong>.
          It‚Äôs oxygen. When one co-founder avoids exposure, while the other
          plays the frontman, the team gets confused. Loyalty dilutes. Authority
          becomes performative.
        </p>
        <p>
          It‚Äôs not a branding problem ‚Äî it‚Äôs an
          <strong>operational fragility</strong>. And eventually, someone pays
          the price.

          These three experiences shaped my understanding of what it means to
          build something with someone.

        The ambiguity in responsibility at the heart of Quan‚Äôs management ‚Äî
        marked by <strong>avoidance</strong>, <strong>blurred roles</strong>,
        and a <strong>lack of steady accountability</strong> ‚Äî struck me the
        most. It naturally led to an archaeology of how this scaffolding was
        laid.
      </p>

      <p>
        When I first considered applying at Quan, I conducted a standard
        ownership check to tailor my motivation email.
        <strong
          >Henrik Kei Siebert was the only visible public figure linked to the
          restaurant</strong
        >, repeatedly cited in hotel communications and online articles as its
        founder.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong
          >No trace of a distinct legal entity operating Quan appeared in public
          records</strong
        >, which left me uncertain about whom to address‚Äîand forced me to send a
        generic, unpersonalized message.
      </p>

      <p>
        My job interview had been conducted by a woman who introduced herself as
        <strong>Sahar</strong>‚Äî"like Sahara", she said. Only later, by
        cross-checking the name in Personalkollen, did I understand she held a
        formal role within <strong>HSSC Event AB</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Despite this, <strong>Henrik Kei Siebert</strong>‚Äîthe only visible
        public figure associated with Quan‚Äîdid not appear anywhere in official
        records. His absence from the company‚Äôs registration was surprising,
        given his public role and occasional presence on site.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>According to the Swedish Beneficial Ownership Register</strong>,
        HSSC Event AB is controlled by KEHDA Holding AB, through which Lin
        Daniella Dahl holds between 50‚Äì75% of the shares. Her name is absent
        from operational documents and restaurant-facing materials.
      </p>

      <p>
        The domain <strong>quanbyquan.se</strong>, which has hosted Quan‚Äôs
        website since 2018, was registered on <strong>24 August 2018</strong>.
        WHOIS data discloses no owner identity, and the site contains no
        <em>impressum</em> or corporate details.
      </p>

      <p>
        Throughout my three weeks of employment at Quan,
        <strong>Saahil Chudasama</strong>‚Äîofficially listed as a co-owner‚Äîwas
        <strong>never seen on-site</strong>. No colleague ever mentioned him,
        and his name played no role in daily operations.
      </p>

      (2018‚Äì2024) confirm none of these elements ever appeared on the site.

      <p>
        Henrik‚Äôs role appeared
        <strong>detached from the daily team flow</strong>. I never witnessed
        him share a joke, give a directive, or interact casually with staff.
        From my position in the back kitchen, he always seemed removed, even
        when physically present.
      </p>
      <p>
        By contrast,
        <strong>Sahar was visibly active in team coordination</strong>. I saw
        her engage directly with the floor manager, the head chef, and multiple
        sous-chefs‚Äîoften inside the kitchen. She also managed interviews and
        subcontractor issues. There was no doubt she operated at the core of
        daily operations.

          üìå Structural Note: Informal Leadership, Formal Incorporation
        </summary>
        <br />

        No internal communication or shared leadership structure was visible
        during the <strong>observed period</strong>. Staff routines followed
        <strong>practical rather than hierarchical logic</strong>, with no
        direct managerial access linked to the
        <strong>two registered owners</strong>.<br /><br />

        This model coexisted with
        <strong>remarkable financial output</strong>‚Äîreportedly over 5 million
        SEK in net profit in 2023, and
        <strong>3 weeks of advance booking</strong> at all times. The later
        registration of <em>Tributum AB</em> may indicate a step toward
        structural consolidation or <em>structural clarity</em>.
      </details>

      <p>
        Tributum AB officially declared a business activity of
        <strong>restaurant operations (restaurangverksamhet)</strong>. Its board
        includes <strong>Henrik Kei Siebert</strong> as CEO,
        <strong>Sahar El Nasser</strong> as board member, and
        <strong>Lin Daniella Dahl</strong> as deputy. This configuration mirrors
        operational roles already observed at Quan.
      </p>

      <p>
        This synchronised registration raises strategic questions. While
        <em>Tributum AB</em> was presented as a formal clarification of
        restaurant activity, <em>Aspiratio</em> could serve as a
        <em>holding or fallback structure</em>, or as a shielded platform
        disconnected from declared payroll operations.

          üìå Structural Insight: Dual Entities, Silent Repositioning
        </summary>

        <p>
          The mirrored setup of <strong>Tributum AB</strong> and
          <strong>Aspiratio Holding AB</strong>, both created on July 1st at the
          same address, goes beyond <strong>administrative convenience</strong>.
          Their design suggests an attempt to
          <strong>redistribute roles</strong>,
          <strong>separate exposures</strong>, and
          <strong>clarify legal responsibility</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          While Tributum declared active restaurant operations,
          <strong>Aspiratio remains structurally dormant</strong>: no payroll,
          no declared business. This silent setup may offer
          <strong>future flexibility</strong>,
          <strong>discreet compensation flows</strong>, or
          <strong>risk management</strong> beyond the main operation.
        </p>
        <p>
          This dual setup could act as a <strong>buffer</strong>‚Äîabsorbing
          pressure, shielding liability, or preparing for change‚Äîwithout public
          disclosure or fiscal trace.
        </p>

        <p>
          Despite being officially registered only as a
          <em>suppleant</em> (alternate board member), her signature confirms an
          <strong>operational role in human resources</strong>. It also implies
          her position as the primary interface with
          <strong>external entities such as HRAK</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Separately, the <strong>employment certificate</strong> issued in my
          name was <strong>signed by Sahar El Nasser</strong>. This formal act
          establishes her involvement in administrative and personnel matters,
          beyond her nominal board position.
