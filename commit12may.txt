+        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
+          A <strong>Holding Company</strong> is an entity created to own shares
+          in one or more other companies, usually without direct commercial
+          operations of its own. Its purpose is to control, consolidate, or
+          protect underlying business assets.
+        </p>
+        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
+          In large corporate groups, a holding might coordinate finance, legal
+          strategy, and investment flows across subsidiaries.
+          <u>In smaller setups or offshore structures</u>, however, holdings may
+          serve more symbolic or strategic purposes ‚Äî such as
+          <span style="background-color: #e5e7eb"
+            >isolating liabilities, fragmenting control, or hiding the true
+            beneficial owner</span
+          >.
+        </p>
+        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
+          The term ‚Äúholding‚Äù does not guarantee operational depth.
+          <strong>In your case, MedFood Holdings Ltd</strong> is registered in
+          Cyprus, has no known employees or infrastructure, and serves
+          exclusively as the legal owner of IzakayaKoi AB post-2004. This is a
+          <u>classic example of a passive holding vehicle</u> ‚Äî potentially
+          designed for tax or opacity purposes.
+        </p>
+        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
+          A holding may appear legitimate in public records, yet be disconnected
+          from the daily operations, which remain handled by nominees or
+          external managers. That‚Äôs why
+          <span style="background-color: #e5e7eb"
+            >the title ‚Äúholding‚Äù must always be cross-examined</span
+          >
+          with actual business substance.
+        </p>
+        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
+          In forensic work, holdings act as anchors: they centralize formal
+          control but may not reflect the real ecosystem of people, payments,
+          and power.
+        </p>
+        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
+          <strong>In corporate genealogy, holdings are structural pivots</strong
+          >: they signal transitions, ownership shifts, or hidden
+          consolidations. Identifying their connections helps reconstruct
+          ownership trees and expose coordination across legal entities.

+          The <strong>Four Corners Rule</strong> is a legal principle stating
+          that a document must be interpreted solely based on what is written
+          ‚Äúwithin its four corners‚Äù ‚Äî meaning the four sides of the paper. No
+          external evidence may be introduced to modify or explain the text

+        </p>
+        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
+          Originating in <strong>Anglo-American contract law</strong>, the
+          doctrine is used in courts to determine the intent of a contract or

+          <u
+            >Everything needed for interpretation must be found in the document

+        </p>
+        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
+          In forensic work, this principle becomes relevant when documents (like
+          shareholder agreements, minutes, audits) are drafted to appear
+          self-contained and unambiguous ‚Äî even when their real function may be
+          to disguise a transfer, an omission, or a hidden beneficiary.

+        </p>
+        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
+          In your case, the principle helps evaluate whether documents (e.g.

+        <ul style="line-height: 1.4">
+          <li>

+          <li>
+            <strong>Geographic Coherence</strong>: Do both companies operate

+          </li>

+            <strong>Financial Coherence</strong>: Are there interlinked cash

+          </li>

+        </ul>
+        <p style="line-height: 1.4">

+        </p>
+        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
+          The original entity (e.g. IzakayaKoi AB) appears to decline in

+        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
+          A <strong>Board Member</strong> is a legally registered director
+          responsible for overseeing and formally representing the company‚Äôs
+          interests. In most jurisdictions, this position grants voting power on
+          key governance issues such as financial reporting, strategic
+          decisions, and executive appointments.
+        </p>
+        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
+          Board Members are usually appointed by shareholders. In larger
+          companies, they are selected for their experience or expertise and may
+          sit as part of a multi-member board with clear role distributions
+          (Chairperson, Treasurer, etc.).
+          <strong
+            >In smaller companies, the board may consist of a single
+            individual</strong
+          >
+          ‚Äî often the founder or a family member ‚Äî making the board structure a

+        </p>
+        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
+          <strong>The presence of only one board member</strong> (especially
+          when coupled with a <em>Deputy Board Member</em> but no wider
+          governance team) often reflects a tightly held company,
+          <strong>possibly a shell entity</strong>, or a low-activity business.
+          In forensic terms, this may suggest risk exposure due to limited
+          oversight or consolidated control.
+        </p>
+        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
+          Board members have <strong>personal legal liability</strong> in cases
+          of fraudulent reporting, tax evasion, or corporate negligence. Their
+          names are typically listed in national company registries and can be
+          tracked across multiple entities to detect patterns of control,
+          influence, or recurring irregularities.
+        </p>
+        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
+          The board structure serves
+          <strong>both functional and symbolic</strong> purposes. In robust
+          firms, it supports governance and transparency. In minimal structures,
+          it may serve only to meet registration requirements while
+          <strong>shielding decision-makers behind formal titles</strong>.
+        </p>
+        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
+          In corporate genealogy, board members are essential markers for
+          tracing continuity and control across legal entities, especially when
+          company names or registration numbers change but human operators

+        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
+          <strong>This position is typically symbolic</strong> and rarely

+          conditions.
+        </p>
+        <p style="line-height: 1.4">

+          >

+          While technically part of the governance framework,

+            >the deputy board member holds no operational role unless

+        </p>
+        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
+          In corporate genealogy, deputy members are worth noting primarily to

+        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
+          <u>Examples include Cyprus, Panama, and Costa Rica</u>. Companies

+        </p>
+        <p style="line-height: 1.4">

+          A <strong>Holding Company</strong> is a legal entity created to own

+        </p>
+        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
+          <u>In large corporate groups</u>, holding companies may centralize

+          <span style="background-color: #e5e7eb"

+          <strong

+        </p>
+        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
+          In forensic analysis, a holding company may act as an anchor ‚Äî it

+        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
+          In corporate genealogy,

-        In <strong>February 2018</strong>, the Renaissance Hotel was acquired by
-        a Swedish group and renamed <strong>Elite Hotel Adlon</strong>. Shortly
-        after, the restaurant project <strong>Quan</strong> was launched on the
-        same premises. Henrik Siebert was introduced as
