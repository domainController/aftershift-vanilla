      <p><u>Heavy Regulation</u></p>

      <p>
        So we have the tax added to everything the customer pays
        (<small>MOMS</small>) (12%), the tax the restaurateur pays on top of
        every salary (31.42%), the tax on <u>company profits</u> (20.6%), and
        the tax the owner pays again to take money out of their own business
        (20%).
      </p>

      <p>
        In 1950, restaurateurs
        <a href="notes.html#note-restaurant-tax-curve" class="note-link"
          >kept around 75%</a
        >
        of their profits. By 1980, under
        <a href="notes.html#note-olof-palme-tax-impact" class="note-link"
          >Olof Palme</a
        >, that dropped to 25%. Since then, caught in one tax
        <a href="notes.html#note-tax-breakdown" class="note-link">cascade</a>
        after another, they end up with <strong>50%</strong> —

        >.
      </p>

      <p></p>
      <p>
        In Sweden, <strong>8.4%</strong> of the national income comes from
        <a
          href="/public/charts/sweden_budget_pie_chart_swedish.html"
          class="chart-link"
          >business taxation</a
        >, <strong>17.3%</strong> from
        <a href="/notes/note_taxation_breakdown.html" class="subtle-link"
          >individual income taxes</a
        >, and <strong>22.4%</strong> from
        <span style="text-decoration: underline">consumption taxes</span>. Since
        a restaurant owner is both an entrepreneur and a consumer, their real
        contribution to the state's budget is significantly higher than the 8.4%
        business share alone.
      </p>

      <p>
        To make matters worse, the sector is still repaying
        <span style="background-color: #e0e0e0"
          >SEK 1.6 billion in Covid-era tax debt</span
        >, affecting more than 1,700 businesses. Monthly repayments tighten
        margins further,
        <strong>trapping restaurateurs in a permanent survival loop</strong>.
        The system does not absorb volatility—it externalizes it to the
        operator.

      <p><u>Rent Trap</u></p>
      <p>
        One of the most overlooked burdens for independent restaurateurs in
        <u>Lilla Torg</u> is the <strong>commercial rent</strong>. Over the past
        few years, lease prices have soared under tourist demand and speculative
        pressure, with increases
        <span style="color: #6b7280"
          >often disconnected from actual revenues</span
        >. Today, large franchises and corporate chains dominate the square,
        <strong>gradually pushing small independents out</strong>. A detailed
        analysis is available in this
        <a href="/notes/lilla-torg-rent.html" class="note_link"
          >dedicated note</a
        >.
      </p>

      <p>
        Alongside that, another silent but equally devastating force has
        emerged: <strong>inflation</strong>. Since 2022, the
        <u>price of electricity and food supplies</u> has surged dramatically.
        The war in Ukraine disrupted Europe’s supply chains,
        <span style="color: #6b7280"
          >triggering spikes in energy and agricultural costs</span
        >. Even the most disciplined restaurateurs saw their margins collapse,
        with no realistic way to pass on the costs to customers. A breakdown of
        this dynamic is provided in this

      <p><u>Intense Labor</u></p>
      <p>
        Staffing eats 25–35% of revenue, yet salaries remain modest. The job
        requires long hours, unpredictable shifts, and multitasking under
        pressure.
        <span class="highlight"
          >The real cost isn’t just payroll — it’s turnover, burnout, and
          absenteeism</span
        >. Labor flexibility becomes both a strategy and a symptom.
      </p>

      <p>
        In my third month in Stockholm (Dec 2023), I logged
        <strong>225 hours</strong> and received <strong>28,653 SEK</strong> —
        but no payslip. It came months later, handed in an envelope, printed on
        an <strong>inkjet printer</strong>, on a
        <strong>sheet sliced with a ruler</strong>, likely from a downloadable
        <strong>Excel payslip template</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        One email later — after an <u>explicit request</u> — the same slip file
        appeared, sent by an <strong>accounting firm</strong>. It showed the
        same <strong>3 lines only</strong>: tips, hours, vacation — no OB1/OB2,
        no deductions, no bonuses. No breakdowns, no audit trail — a flattened
        sum, legally silent, strategically opaque.

      <p>
        Ingredient costs spike weekly: salmon, oil, herbs, even flour. Delays
        disrupt menu logic. Storage is limited, and waste accumulates fast.
        Seasonal menus offer no protection.
        <span class="highlight"

        <span class="highlight">46%</span>, while average menu prices only rose
        <span class="highlight">20%</span>. Raw costs outpaced income.
        Restaurants absorbed the gap — shrinking portions, trimming staff, or

      <p>
        <u>First infraction: undeclared staff.</u> Too expensive, too unstable,
        too easy to justify. “It’s just a trial.” “He’s only here for the
        weekend.” “We’ll declare him next month.” But the truth is simpler:
        there’s no room in the numbers. So he disappears from the books.
      </p>

      <p>
        <u>Second infraction: hybrid contracts.</u> Half fixed, half variable.
        Clauses never applied, hours never counted. Cooks sign for 20 but work
        60. The owner knows. The staff knows. No one complains — everyone hopes
        it won’t last. It always lasts.
      </p>

      <p>
        <u>Third infraction: invisible overtime.</u> Prep starts 45 minutes
        before clock-in. Cleanup ends 30 minutes after shift-out. Lunch break
        skipped, split shifts extended. “It’s how the job is.” Everyone accepts,
        no one logs it. Time disappears. And with it, the evidence.
      </p>

      <p>
        Over time,
        <strong>these infractions stop looking like infractions</strong>.
        They’re baked into pricing, scheduling, margin projections. You can’t
        remove them — you’d have to raise prices, cut hours, or shut down. So
        they stay. And everyone stays silent.

        This isn’t an industry that defrauds by ambition. It’s a system that
        <u>trains people to survive through evasion</u>. That’s the real
        culture:
        <strong>not criminal intent, but institutionalized adaptation</strong>.
        What survives is what bends.

      <p><u>Financial Discrepancies</u></p>
      <p>
        Over time, I noticed not everyone was paid the same way.
        <strong>Some had full schedules, but reported little on paper.</strong>
        Others had side arrangements. This created invisible hierarchies. The
        more dependent someone was, the more toxic their behavior. One
        colleague, particularly abusive, remained untouchable.

          After one month and three weeks at <strong>Da Peppe Due</strong>,
          suspicions about my sobriety emerged. Three colleagues: a

          <strong>63-year-old chef</strong>; and a third,
          <strong>Muslim waiter around 40</strong>, subtly influential. The more

          <strong>struggled with a single staircase</strong>.

          Ironically, the 25-year-old who raised suspicions had
          <u>back pain</u> and often asked me to lift for him. Yet he
          <a href="#" class="subtle-link">served alcohol daily</a>. Being
          labeled by him felt <strong>obscene</strong>. So I proposed a
          challenge: fail a breath test, and I’d pay 50 SEK or
          <strong>run 10 km at 10 km/h</strong>.

        <p>
          Later, I learned "Tutti" — an Indonesian server in her 50s, very kind
          — drank regularly after her shift. Colleagues tolerated it, sometimes
          serving her directly. On Saturdays, she asked me to escort her to the
          train; most other days, she used a different station. It had always
          struck me as odd.
        </p>

          I proposed a breath-test challenge: fail and I’d pay 50 SEK or
          <strong>run 10 km at 10 km/h</strong>. The
          <strong>owner left the group instantly</strong>. Only later did I
          realize: he used his

          driving.

          <strong>First Glimpse: The Dishwasher Job in Hamburg (2012)</strong>

        <p>
          In April–May 2017, I worked as a dishwasher at

          cleaned the machine area and took initiative to restore the back
          facade and staff zone.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nobody said a word. No warnings, no frowns.
          <strong>It was routine</strong>. And yet this man was giving orders,
          shaping service, barking instructions at the staff. When I told the
          owner, her only response was, “I’ll talk to him.”
          <span class="highlight">Nothing changed</span>.

          3. Ex-Girlfriend Waitress Saw 3 Alcoholic Chefs in 6 Years in
          Australia
        </h2>
        <p>
          Later, my partner—who had spent six years as a waitress in
          Australia—confirmed what I’d seen. She recalled
          <strong>cooks getting drunk mid-shift</strong>, treating it like a
          badge of honour. I began to see a broader pattern: kitchens where
          alcohol wasn’t hidden but <strong>normalized</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          This wasn’t just about indulgence. It was about silence. A culture
          where
          <strong>denial, tolerance, and complicity</strong> formed a triangle
          of dysfunction. I’ve been the odd one out my whole life—<strong
            >the guy at the club drinking soda</strong
          >. When I spoke out, I was met with disbelief, deflection, and
          sometimes outright hostility.

        <h2>The Loyalty Contract</h2>
        <p>
          When someone
          <strong>trusts you, feeds you, listens to you</strong>—you want to
          give back. I filled in when needed. I cleaned more than asked. That
          mutual understanding kept everything running. Even if unspoken.
        </p>
        <p>
          In some restaurants, leniency is not a managerial style — it’s a
          shield. Employers allow small rule-bending in exchange for loyalty and
          silence. You get to snack, check your phone, stay a little loose — as
          long as you don't destabilize the structure or speak too much.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            I spent 14 months as a dishwasher in a high-volume establishment
            where I was paid on time, listened to, and respected.
          </li>
          <li>
            We were encouraged to rest during downtime. No one punished phone
            use during calm periods.
          </li>
          <li>
            The chef wanted smooth operations and no drama. That attitude shaped
            the atmosphere for everyone.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p><u>Loyalty Through Trust</u></p>
        <p>
          My manager never interrogated my movements. That kind of restraint
          earns you loyalty. And I gave it. Even now, I struggle to criticize
          him publicly—not because everything was flawless, but because his
          <strong>human decency</strong> was real.
        </p>

        <p><u>Systemic Tolerance of Toxicity</u></p>
        <p>
          The staff was mostly Turkish. A long-time Greek cook—<strong
            >loud, degrading, and borderline cruel</strong
          >—was tolerated. Management stayed silent, waiting for him to leave on
          his own terms. <strong>Silence was easier than confrontation.</strong>
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="culture-block" id="culture-silence">
        <h2 id="culture-silence">Culture of Silence</h2>

        <p><u>Unspoken Rules and Invisible Limits</u></p>
        <p>
          The freedoms were real. <strong>No one clock-watched.</strong> I could
          vanish for 45 minutes, take breaks as I wished, even start shifts two
          hours before any activity. Presence only mattered when it mattered.
          But beneath that liberty was <strong>silent monitoring</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Dishwashing shifts ran in <strong>flexible pairs</strong>. If one
          didn’t show, the other adapted—no explanations needed. It was a
          workplace built on trust—but <strong>bounded by silence</strong>.
        </p>
        <h2>The Line I Never Crossed</h2>
        <p>
          And because of that, I can’t betray him. I’ve seen things—but I won’t
          speak of them here.
          <strong>He gave me space. He gave me dignity.</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          Everyone knows what not to say. Complaints stay inside. Problems get
          absorbed by the team — not solved. The silence is not passive; it's a
          strategic, distributed defense. If no one speaks, no one gets exposed.
        </p>

        <p><u>Silent Control</u></p>
        <p>
          At Da Peppe Due, the system was more polished.
          <strong>Nothing was explicit—but everything was controlled.</strong>
          The manager never raised his voice. He didn’t micromanage. His mere
          presence shaped how people behaved. It wasn’t fear—it was calibration.
        </p>

        <p>
          What struck me most wasn’t discipline—it was
          <strong>generosity</strong>. From day one, I was paid properly,
          allowed to eat premium meals, and encouraged to ask for raises. This
          kindness created an invisible contract: enjoy everything,
          <strong>as long as you don’t cross a line</strong>.
        </p>

        <p><u>Quiet Generosity</u></p>
        <p>
          Despite the flaws, generosity flowed. Former staff, kids, and friends
          of the owner often ate for free. No announcement, no posters—just an
          <strong>unspoken rule of belonging</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          I was paid fully and on time. Once, after a delay, I received a bank
          transfer within hours. He listened to me. He offered more than I
          asked. And I <strong>refused his Facebook request</strong>—not out of
          spite, but to maintain boundaries. He wasn’t trying to impress anyone.
          He was just kind.

        <ul>

            The law may not always be followed, but respect can compensate. That
            was the deal.

          <li>
            At that restaurant, I had access to quality meals, flexible breaks,
            and autonomy—all without fear.
          </li>
          <li>
            I was even offered a raise without asking. These gestures forged a

        <h2>Culture of Secrecy</h2>
        <p>
          My restaurant background spans roughly <strong>two years</strong>,
          with the longest stretch—<strong>14 months</strong>—spent at
          <u>Da Peppe Due</u> in Stockholm. This job coincided with a moment
          where I became more observant of what made a kitchen thrive—or quietly
          rot.
        </p>

        <p>
          One of my first shocks came during a
          <strong>trial shift at RIPIG</strong>. I offered to work two unpaid
          hours. The owner panicked and ordered me to clock in
          <em>immediately</em>. Her tone revealed a deep-seated fear:
          <strong>legality here meant invisibility</strong>, not compliance.
          That moment marked my first encounter with the sector's unwritten
          rules.
        </p>

        <h2>Resentment of Vitality</h2>
        <p>
          In a kitchen running on <strong>fatigue and inertia</strong>, my
          energy—fueled by sleep, nutrition, and training—became suspicious. I
          moved fast, lifted heavy, stayed alert. Others resented that. It felt
          absurd to be <strong>whispered about simply for being alive</strong>.
        </p>

        <h2 id="culture-evasion">Culture of Evasion</h2>

        <p>
          Evasion doesn’t scream. It whispers. Contracts unsigned, slips
          delayed, trails erased. Everything is there — just never all at once.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>1. Missing documents, missing responsibilities.</b>
          No onboarding papers. Payslips delayed, partial, or absent. When
          pressure comes, nothing formal can be held.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>2. Accounting opacity as method.</b>
          External accounting firms issue neutral slips — 3 lines, no context.
          Details fade: no overtime, no tax logic, no breakdowns. Visibility is
          optional.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>3. Bankruptcy as exit strategy.</b>
          When claims rise, structures collapse. Companies fold, partners
          vanish, and no one stays accountable. It’s not disappearance — it’s a
          reset.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>4. Hidden ownership, offshore instincts.</b>
          Ownership passes through wives, brothers, or ghost firms. Sometimes
          offshore, always unnamed. Secrecy isn’t the tactic — it’s the
          framework.
        </p>

        <h2>Standing My Ground</h2>
        <p>
          In the early months, a server tried to boss me around. I drew a line:
          I belonged to the kitchen, not the floor. The manager pulled me
          aside—not to shout, but to warn. I adapted. I
          <strong>learned the hierarchy</strong>. And I stayed 14 months.
