      <h1>📃 Structural Realities in the Restaurant Sector</h1>

      <p class="lead">
        This page opens a fourth dimension to the
        <strong>Narrative Grid</strong>: the sectoral backdrop that shaped how I
        experienced work before Quan. It contrasts two kitchen cultures—one
        respectful, one dismissive—while grounding both in economic realities.
      </p>

      <hr />

      <h2>④ Kitchen Structure: A Sectoral Overview</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Average net margins for Swedish restaurants remain between
          <strong>2.5% and 8%</strong>, with intense seasonal fluctuations.
        </li>
        <li>
          Informal infractions are common: undocumented overtime, undeclared
          staff, hybrid contract practices.
        </li>
        <li>
          Structural pressure is widespread—but how that pressure is distributed
          varies radically.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Case Comparison: A Restaurant That Let Me Breathe</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I spent 14 months as a dishwasher in a high-volume establishment where
          I was paid on time, listened to, and respected.
        </li>
        <li>
          We were encouraged to rest during downtime. No one punished phone use
          during calm periods.
        </li>
        <li>
          The chef wanted smooth operations and no drama. That attitude shaped
          the atmosphere for everyone.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>
        Trust as Compensation: What Makes a Rule-Bending Workplace Acceptable
      </h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The law may not always be followed, but respect can compensate. That
          was the deal.
        </li>
        <li>
          At that restaurant, I had access to quality meals, flexible breaks,
          and autonomy—all without fear.
        </li>
        <li>
          I was even offered a raise without asking. These gestures forged a
          kind of social contract.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Culture of Secrecy</h2>
      <p>
        My restaurant background spans roughly <strong>two years</strong>, with
        the longest stretch—<strong>14 months</strong>—spent at
        <u>Da Peppe Due</u> in Stockholm. This job coincided with a moment where
        I became more observant of what made a kitchen thrive—or quietly rot.
      </p>

      <p>
        One of my first shocks came during a
        <strong>trial shift at RIPIG</strong>. I offered to work two unpaid
        hours. The owner panicked and ordered me to clock in
        <em>immediately</em>. Her tone revealed a deep-seated fear:
        <strong>legality here meant invisibility</strong>, not compliance. That
        moment marked my first encounter with the sector's unwritten rules.
      </p>

      <h2>Silent Control</h2>
      <p>
        At Da Peppe Due, the system was more polished.
        <strong>Nothing was explicit—but everything was controlled.</strong> The
        manager never raised his voice. He didn’t micromanage. His mere presence
        shaped how people behaved. It wasn’t fear—it was calibration.
      </p>

      <p>
        What struck me most wasn’t discipline—it was
        <strong>generosity</strong>. From day one, I was paid properly, allowed
        to eat premium meals, and encouraged to ask for raises. This kindness
        created an invisible contract: enjoy everything,
        <strong>as long as you don’t cross a line</strong>.
      </p>

      <h2>Unspoken Rules and Invisible Limits</h2>
      <p>
        The freedoms were real. <strong>No one clock-watched.</strong> I could
        vanish for 45 minutes, take breaks as I wished, even start shifts two
        hours before any activity. Presence only mattered when it mattered. But
        beneath that liberty was <strong>silent monitoring</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Dishwashing shifts ran in <strong>flexible pairs</strong>. If one didn’t
        show, the other adapted—no explanations needed. It was a workplace built
        on trust—but <strong>bounded by silence</strong>.
      </p>

      <h2>Loyalty Through Trust</h2>
      <p>
        My manager never interrogated my movements. That kind of restraint earns
        you loyalty. And I gave it. Even now, I struggle to criticize him
        publicly—not because everything was flawless, but because his
        <strong>human decency</strong> was real.
      </p>

      <h2>Financial Discrepancies</h2>
      <p>
        Over time, I noticed not everyone was paid the same way.
        <strong>Some had full schedules, but reported little on paper.</strong>
        Others had side arrangements. This created invisible hierarchies. The
        more dependent someone was, the more toxic their behavior. One
        colleague, particularly abusive, remained untouchable.
      </p>

      <h2>Culture of alcoholism</h2>

      <h2>Accused of Drinking for Carrying a Flask at Da Peppe Due (2023)</h2>
      <p>
        After one month and three weeks working as a dishwasher at
        <strong>Da Peppe Due</strong>, I faced repeated insinuations from two
        colleagues suggesting I had a drinking problem. One was
        <strong>25 years old</strong>, the de facto manager; the other was an
        older, <strong>practicing Muslim chef</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The younger one asked if I drank. I answered honestly: I rarely did.
        Mostly with food, and never heavily. But the questioning felt
        <strong>insistent</strong>, and the more I stayed vague, the more
        suspicious they seemed.
      </p>

      <p>
        As an <strong>endurance athlete</strong>, I brought a Camelbak flask to
        work daily. It often contained <u>BCAA, cinnamon, glutamine</u>, or
        <u>protein blends</u>. Mixtures that might appear unusual if seen in a
        transparent bottle.
      </p>

      <p>
        I used the same stainless flask for <u>trekking and gym</u> for years.
        Its presence became a focal point. I drank often, in small sips—like
        athletes do. But it stood out in a workplace where people
        <strong>struggled with a single staircase</strong>.
      </p>

      <div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px">
        <img
          src="./assets/img/Camelbak_chute_mag_Da_Peppe_Due_table_2023.jpg"
          alt="Camelbak flask on the table at Da Peppe Due"
          style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 8px"
        />
      </div>
      <p>
        Ironically, the 25-year-old who raised suspicions had
        <u>back pain</u> and frequently asked me to lift for him. I helped
        willingly. But being labeled an alcoholic by someone who
        <u>served alcohol daily</u> and likely partied each weekend felt
        <strong>obscene</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        I eventually created a WhatsApp group and proposed a deal: anyone
        suspicious could ask me to blow into a breathalyzer. If negative, they’d
        owe me 50 SEK or <strong>run 10 km at 10 km/h</strong> with me. I’d
        cover costs if I failed.
      </p>

      <div style="text-align: center; margin: 15px 0">
        <img
          src="./assets/img/WhatsApp_group_complain.jpg"
          alt="Screenshot of WhatsApp group message"
          style="
            max-width: 70%;
            height: auto;
            border-radius: 8px;
            box-shadow: 0 0 8px #999;
          "
        />
      </div>

      <p>
        All joined the group. But the owner—who drove a
        <strong>Tesla Model Y</strong> and regularly drank wine with
        friends—left instantly. Only later did I understand: I saw him use his
        <strong>personal breathalyzer 2–3 times per week</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The joke had struck a nerve. He later told me, “<em
          >Patrice, you can’t take a joke</em
        >.” But this wasn’t a joke. I’ve seen addiction up close. I don’t drink
        to numb anything—I drink like people
        <strong>treat dark chocolate</strong>: aesthetic, occasional, never
        essential.
      </p>

      <p>
        In three years in Sweden, I’ve bought alcohol
        <strong>maybe three times</strong>, always with my ex-girlfriend. I
        drink <u>sparkling water, filmjölk, syrup mixes</u>, and custom
        <strong>supplement blends</strong>. Beer tastes like
        <strong>piss</strong> to me.
      </p>

      <p>
        In <strong>3 years in Sweden</strong>, I’ve bought alcohol 2–3 times,
        always with my ex-girlfriend. I treat wine like
        <strong>dark chocolate</strong>: aesthetic, occasional, never necessary.
      </p>

      <p>
        I had a <strong>gym membership at SATS</strong> (previously Nordic
        Wellness). I trained almost daily—either running or gym. My personal
        rule: <strong>never go two days without training</strong>. I’ll link my
        <a href="#">Strava</a> profile here.
      </p>

      <p>
        Despite the conflict, I was <u>welcomed</u> by most staff. The kitchen
        crew was warm. I always helped, ran to assist, and often
        <strong>brought cinnamon buns and CORNY bars</strong> to share. That
        habit lasted until my last week.
      </p>
      <div style="text-align: center; margin: 15px 0">
        <img
          src="./assets/img/corny.jpg"

            box-shadow: 0 0 8px #999;
          "
        />
      </div>

      <p>
        I even offered farewell gifts to each team member. It was my way of
        making peace with a moment that had left a mark. A
        <strong>misunderstanding about a flask</strong> turned into a culture
        clash—between <u>fitness and indulgence</u>.
      </p>

      <h3>
        2. <strong>First Glimpse: The Dishwasher Job in Hamburg (2012)</strong>
      </h3>
      <p>
        Ten years earlier, in Germany, I worked a two-month stint as a
        dishwasher in a mid-sized restaurant outside Hamburg. It was my first
        real encounter with the inner workings of kitchen culture. The chef
        supervising me had a strange energy—<strong
          >erratic, dominating, even hysterical</strong
        >. At first, I chalked it up to personality or stress. But then I saw
        it: every evening, once management left,
        <strong>he’d pour himself a beer on tap</strong>. Then another. And
        another.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nobody said a word. No warnings, no frowns.
        <strong>It was routine</strong>. And yet this man was giving orders,
        shaping service, barking instructions at the staff. When I told the
        owner, her only response was, “I’ll talk to him.”
        <span class="highlight">Nothing changed</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was a defining moment. I realized then that
        <strong
          >alcohol was not just tolerated—it was culturally embedded</strong
        >
        in parts of this industry. A kind of silent contract: work hard, drink
        hard. It explained the toxic moods, the unpredictable bursts of emotion,
        the late-night chaos.
      </p>

      <h2>
        3. Ex-Girlfriend Waitress Saw 3 Alcoholic Chefs in 6 Years in Australia
      </h2>
      <p>
        Later, my partner—who had spent six years as a waitress in
        Australia—confirmed what I’d seen. She recalled
        <strong>cooks getting drunk mid-shift</strong>, treating it like a badge
        of honour. I began to see a broader pattern: kitchens where alcohol
        wasn’t hidden but <strong>normalized</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This wasn’t just about indulgence. It was about silence. A culture where
        <strong>denial, tolerance, and complicity</strong> formed a triangle of
        dysfunction. I’ve been the odd one out my whole life—<strong
          >the guy at the club drinking soda</strong
        >. When I spoke out, I was met with disbelief, deflection, and sometimes
        outright hostility.
      </p>
      <p>
        When chefs drink and nobody cares, but an athlete sipping electrolytes
        is called an alcoholic, that says everything about what’s broken.
      </p>

      <h2>Resentment of Vitality</h2>
      <p>
        In a kitchen running on <strong>fatigue and inertia</strong>, my
        energy—fueled by sleep, nutrition, and training—became suspicious. I
        moved fast, lifted heavy, stayed alert. Others resented that. It felt
        absurd to be <strong>whispered about simply for being alive</strong>.
      </p>

      <h2>Systemic Tolerance of Toxicity</h2>
      <p>
        The staff was mostly Turkish. A long-time Greek cook—<strong
          >loud, degrading, and borderline cruel</strong
        >—was tolerated. Management stayed silent, waiting for him to leave on
        his own terms. <strong>Silence was easier than confrontation.</strong>
      </p>

      <h2>Quiet Generosity</h2>
      <p>
        Despite the flaws, generosity flowed. Former staff, kids, and friends of
        the owner often ate for free. No announcement, no posters—just an
        <strong>unspoken rule of belonging</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        I was paid fully and on time. Once, after a delay, I received a bank
        transfer within hours. He listened to me. He offered more than I asked.
        And I <strong>refused his Facebook request</strong>—not out of spite,
        but to maintain boundaries. He wasn’t trying to impress anyone. He was
        just kind.
      </p>

      <h2>The Line I Never Crossed</h2>
      <p>
        And because of that, I can’t betray him. I’ve seen things—but I won’t
        speak of them here.
        <strong>He gave me space. He gave me dignity.</strong>
      </p>

      <h2>Standing My Ground</h2>
      <p>
        In the early months, a server tried to boss me around. I drew a line: I
        belonged to the kitchen, not the floor. The manager pulled me aside—not
        to shout, but to warn. I adapted. I
        <strong>learned the hierarchy</strong>. And I stayed 14 months.
      </p>

      <h2>The Loyalty Contract</h2>
      <p>
        When someone <strong>trusts you, feeds you, listens to you</strong>—you
        want to give back. I filled in when needed. I cleaned more than asked.
        That mutual understanding kept everything running. Even if unspoken.
      </p>

      <h2>Quan's Failure Was Not Structural—It Was Personal</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Quan's setup wasn’t impossible. The real failure came from how one
          person enforced it.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="highlight"
            >Sahar's attitude combined legal opacity with open hostility</span
          >.
        </li>
        <li>
          Had someone else been in charge, I might have stayed. It wasn't the
          floor plan. It was the leadership.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Closing Note: Contextual Shielding</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          This section exists to preempt bad-faith critiques that I was unstable
          or unrealistic.
        </li>
        <li>
          It shows that I thrived in another setting, under pressure, with high
          standards—as long as mutual respect was there.
        </li>
        <li>This is not a romanticized detour. It's structural testimony.</li>
