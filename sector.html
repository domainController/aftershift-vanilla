      <p><u>Intense Labor</u></p>
      <p>
        Staffing eats 25–35% of revenue, yet salaries remain modest. The job
        requires long hours, unpredictable shifts, and multitasking under
        pressure.
        <span class="highlight"

      </p>

      <p>
        In my third month in Stockholm (Dec 2023), I logged
        <strong>225 hours</strong> and received <strong>28,653 SEK</strong> —
        but no payslip. It came months later, handed in an envelope, printed on
        an <strong>inkjet printer</strong>, on a
        <strong>sheet sliced with a ruler</strong>, likely from a downloadable
        <strong>Excel payslip template</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        One email later — after an <u>explicit request</u> — the same slip file
        appeared, sent by an <strong>accounting firm</strong>. It showed the
        same <strong>3 lines only</strong>: tips, hours, vacation — no OB1/OB2,
        no deductions, no bonuses. No breakdowns, no audit trail — a flattened
        sum, legally silent, strategically opaque.

      <p><u>Fragile Supply Chain</u></p>
      <p>
        Ingredient costs spike weekly: salmon, oil, herbs, even flour. Delays
        disrupt menu logic. Storage is limited, and waste accumulates fast.
        Seasonal menus offer no protection.

      <p><u>Heavy Regulation</u></p>
      <p>
        From VAT declarations to hygiene audits, the bureaucracy is relentless.
        In Sweden, VAT on food service is 12%. In France, it's 10%. In Denmark,
        25%. Meanwhile, the US varies between 2–7.25%, and Dubai sits at 5%.

        <u>He doesn’t scale, he absorbs.</u> He doesn’t fight, he adapts. He

        avoidance becomes operating mode.
      </p>

      <p>
        <u>First infraction: undeclared staff.</u> Too expensive, too unstable,
        too easy to justify. “It’s just a trial.” “He’s only here for the
        weekend.” “We’ll declare him next month.” But the truth is simpler:
        there’s no room in the numbers. So he disappears from the books.
      </p>

      <p>
        <u>Second infraction: hybrid contracts.</u> Half fixed, half variable.
        Clauses never applied, hours never counted. Cooks sign for 20 but work
        60. The owner knows. The staff knows. No one complains — everyone hopes
        it won’t last. It always lasts.
      </p>

      <p>
        <u>Third infraction: invisible overtime.</u> Prep starts 45 minutes
        before clock-in. Cleanup ends 30 minutes after shift-out. Lunch break
        skipped, split shifts extended. “It’s how the job is.” Everyone accepts,
        no one logs it. Time disappears. And with it, the evidence.
      </p>

      <p>
        Over time,
        <strong>these infractions stop looking like infractions</strong>.
        They’re baked into pricing, scheduling, margin projections. You can’t
        remove them — you’d have to raise prices, cut hours, or shut down. So
        they stay. And everyone stays silent.
      </p>

      <p>
        This isn’t an industry that defrauds by ambition. It’s a system that
        <u>trains people to survive through evasion</u>. That’s the real
        culture:
        <strong>not criminal intent, but institutionalized adaptation</strong>.
        What survives is what bends.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li></li>
        <li>
          Informal infractions are common: undocumented overtime, undeclared
          staff, hybrid contract practices.
        </li>
        <li>
          Structural pressure is widespread—but how that pressure is distributed
          varies radically.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p><u>Financial Discrepancies</u></p>
      <p>
        Over time, I noticed not everyone was paid the same way.
        <strong>Some had full schedules, but reported little on paper.</strong>
        Others had side arrangements. This created invisible hierarchies. The
        more dependent someone was, the more toxic their behavior. One
        colleague, particularly abusive, remained untouchable.

          <u>Accused of Drinking for Carrying a Flask at Da Peppe Due (2023)</u>
        </p>
        <p>
          After one month and three weeks working as a dishwasher at
          <strong>Da Peppe Due</strong>, I faced repeated insinuations from two
          colleagues suggesting I had a drinking problem. One was
          <strong>25 years old</strong>, the de facto manager; the other was an
          older, <strong>practicing Muslim chef</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          The younger one asked if I drank. I answered honestly: I rarely did.
          Mostly with food, and never heavily. But the questioning felt
          <strong>insistent</strong>, and the more I stayed vague, the more
          suspicious they seemed.
        </p>

        <p>
          As an <strong>endurance athlete</strong>, I brought a Camelbak flask
          to work daily. It often contained <u>BCAA, cinnamon, glutamine</u>, or
          <u>protein blends</u>. Mixtures that might appear unusual if seen in a
          transparent bottle.
        </p>

        <p>
          I used the same stainless flask for <u>trekking and gym</u> for years.
          Its presence became a focal point. I drank often, in small sips—like
          athletes do. But it stood out in a workplace where people
          <strong>struggled with a single staircase</strong>.
        </p>

          />
        </div>
        <p>
          Ironically, the 25-year-old who raised suspicions had
          <u>back pain</u> and frequently asked me to lift for him. I helped
          willingly. But being labeled an alcoholic by someone who
          <u>served alcohol daily</u> and likely partied each weekend felt
          <strong>obscene</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          I eventually created a WhatsApp group and proposed a deal: anyone
          suspicious could ask me to blow into a breathalyzer. If negative,
          they’d owe me 50 SEK or <strong>run 10 km at 10 km/h</strong> with me.
          I’d cover costs if I failed.
        </p>

        <div style="text-align: center; margin: 15px 0">

            "
          />
        </div>

        <p>
          All joined the group. But the owner—who drove a
          <strong>Tesla Model Y</strong> and regularly drank wine with
          friends—left instantly. Only later did I understand: I saw him use his
          <strong>personal breathalyzer 2–3 times per week</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          The joke had struck a nerve. He later told me, “<em
            >Patrice, you can’t take a joke</em
          >.” But this wasn’t a joke. I’ve seen addiction up close. I don’t
          drink to numb anything—I drink like people
          <strong>treat dark chocolate</strong>: aesthetic, occasional, never
          essential.

        <p>
          In three years in Sweden, I’ve bought alcohol
          <strong>maybe three times</strong>, always with my ex-girlfriend. I
          drink <u>sparkling water, filmjölk, syrup mixes</u>, and custom
          <strong>supplement blends</strong>. Beer tastes like
          <strong>piss</strong> to me.

        <p>
          In <strong>3 years in Sweden</strong>, I’ve bought alcohol 2–3 times,
          always with my ex-girlfriend. I treat wine like
          <strong>dark chocolate</strong>: aesthetic, occasional, never
          necessary.
        </p>

        <p>
          I had a <strong>gym membership at SATS</strong> (previously Nordic
          Wellness). I trained almost daily—either running or gym. My personal
          rule: <strong>never go two days without training</strong>. I’ll link
          my <a href="#">Strava</a> profile here.
        </p>

        <p>
          Despite the conflict, I was <u>welcomed</u> by most staff. The kitchen
          crew was warm. I always helped, ran to assist, and often
          <strong>brought cinnamon buns and CORNY bars</strong> to share. That
          habit lasted until my last week.

          I even offered farewell gifts to each team member. It was my way of
          making peace with a moment that had left a mark. A
          <strong>misunderstanding about a flask</strong> turned into a culture
          clash—between <u>fitness and indulgence</u>.

          2.
          <strong>First Glimpse: The Dishwasher Job in Hamburg (2012)</strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          Ten years earlier, in Germany, I worked a two-month stint as a
          dishwasher in a mid-sized restaurant outside Hamburg. It was my first
          real encounter with the inner workings of kitchen culture. The chef
          supervising me had a strange energy—<strong
            >erratic, dominating, even hysterical</strong
          >. At first, I chalked it up to personality or stress. But then I saw
          it: every evening, once management left,
          <strong>he’d pour himself a beer on tap</strong>. Then another. And
          another.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nobody said a word. No warnings, no frowns.
          <strong>It was routine</strong>. And yet this man was giving orders,
          shaping service, barking instructions at the staff. When I told the
          owner, her only response was, “I’ll talk to him.”
          <span class="highlight">Nothing changed</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was a defining moment. I realized then that
          <strong
            >alcohol was not just tolerated—it was culturally embedded</strong
          >
          in parts of this industry. A kind of silent contract: work hard, drink
          hard. It explained the toxic moods, the unpredictable bursts of
          emotion, the late-night chaos.
        </p>

        <h2>
          3. Ex-Girlfriend Waitress Saw 3 Alcoholic Chefs in 6 Years in
          Australia
        </h2>
        <p>
          Later, my partner—who had spent six years as a waitress in
          Australia—confirmed what I’d seen. She recalled
          <strong>cooks getting drunk mid-shift</strong>, treating it like a
          badge of honour. I began to see a broader pattern: kitchens where
          alcohol wasn’t hidden but <strong>normalized</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          This wasn’t just about indulgence. It was about silence. A culture
          where
          <strong>denial, tolerance, and complicity</strong> formed a triangle
          of dysfunction. I’ve been the odd one out my whole life—<strong
            >the guy at the club drinking soda</strong
          >. When I spoke out, I was met with disbelief, deflection, and
          sometimes outright hostility.
        </p>
        <p>
          When chefs drink and nobody cares, but an athlete sipping electrolytes
          is called an alcoholic, that says everything about what’s broken.

        <h2>The Loyalty Contract</h2>
        <p>
          When someone
          <strong>trusts you, feeds you, listens to you</strong>—you want to
          give back. I filled in when needed. I cleaned more than asked. That
          mutual understanding kept everything running. Even if unspoken.
        </p>
        <p>
          In some restaurants, leniency is not a managerial style — it’s a
          shield. Employers allow small rule-bending in exchange for loyalty and
          silence. You get to snack, check your phone, stay a little loose — as
          long as you don't destabilize the structure or speak too much.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            I spent 14 months as a dishwasher in a high-volume establishment
            where I was paid on time, listened to, and respected.
          </li>
          <li>
            We were encouraged to rest during downtime. No one punished phone
            use during calm periods.
          </li>
          <li>
            The chef wanted smooth operations and no drama. That attitude shaped
            the atmosphere for everyone.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p><u>Loyalty Through Trust</u></p>
        <p>
          My manager never interrogated my movements. That kind of restraint
          earns you loyalty. And I gave it. Even now, I struggle to criticize
          him publicly—not because everything was flawless, but because his
          <strong>human decency</strong> was real.
        </p>

        <p><u>Systemic Tolerance of Toxicity</u></p>
        <p>
          The staff was mostly Turkish. A long-time Greek cook—<strong
            >loud, degrading, and borderline cruel</strong
          >—was tolerated. Management stayed silent, waiting for him to leave on
          his own terms. <strong>Silence was easier than confrontation.</strong>
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="culture-block" id="culture-silence">
        <h2 id="culture-silence">Culture of Silence</h2>

        <p><u>Unspoken Rules and Invisible Limits</u></p>
        <p>
          The freedoms were real. <strong>No one clock-watched.</strong> I could
          vanish for 45 minutes, take breaks as I wished, even start shifts two
          hours before any activity. Presence only mattered when it mattered.
          But beneath that liberty was <strong>silent monitoring</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Dishwashing shifts ran in <strong>flexible pairs</strong>. If one
          didn’t show, the other adapted—no explanations needed. It was a
          workplace built on trust—but <strong>bounded by silence</strong>.
        </p>
        <h2>The Line I Never Crossed</h2>
        <p>
          And because of that, I can’t betray him. I’ve seen things—but I won’t
          speak of them here.
          <strong>He gave me space. He gave me dignity.</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          Everyone knows what not to say. Complaints stay inside. Problems get
          absorbed by the team — not solved. The silence is not passive; it's a
          strategic, distributed defense. If no one speaks, no one gets exposed.
        </p>

        <p><u>Silent Control</u></p>
        <p>
          At Da Peppe Due, the system was more polished.
          <strong>Nothing was explicit—but everything was controlled.</strong>
          The manager never raised his voice. He didn’t micromanage. His mere
          presence shaped how people behaved. It wasn’t fear—it was calibration.
        </p>

        <p>
          What struck me most wasn’t discipline—it was
          <strong>generosity</strong>. From day one, I was paid properly,
          allowed to eat premium meals, and encouraged to ask for raises. This
          kindness created an invisible contract: enjoy everything,
          <strong>as long as you don’t cross a line</strong>.
        </p>

        <p><u>Quiet Generosity</u></p>
        <p>
          Despite the flaws, generosity flowed. Former staff, kids, and friends
          of the owner often ate for free. No announcement, no posters—just an
          <strong>unspoken rule of belonging</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          I was paid fully and on time. Once, after a delay, I received a bank
          transfer within hours. He listened to me. He offered more than I
          asked. And I <strong>refused his Facebook request</strong>—not out of
          spite, but to maintain boundaries. He wasn’t trying to impress anyone.
          He was just kind.

          <li>
            At that restaurant, I had access to quality meals, flexible breaks,
            and autonomy—all without fear.
          </li>
          <li>
            I was even offered a raise without asking. These gestures forged a
            kind of social contract.

      <div class="culture-block" id="culture-secrecy">
        <h2>Culture of Secrecy</h2>
        <p>
          My restaurant background spans roughly <strong>two years</strong>,
          with the longest stretch—<strong>14 months</strong>—spent at
          <u>Da Peppe Due</u> in Stockholm. This job coincided with a moment
          where I became more observant of what made a kitchen thrive—or quietly
          rot.
        </p>

        <p>
          One of my first shocks came during a
          <strong>trial shift at RIPIG</strong>. I offered to work two unpaid
          hours. The owner panicked and ordered me to clock in
          <em>immediately</em>. Her tone revealed a deep-seated fear:
          <strong>legality here meant invisibility</strong>, not compliance.
          That moment marked my first encounter with the sector's unwritten
          rules.
        </p>

        <h2>Resentment of Vitality</h2>
        <p>
          In a kitchen running on <strong>fatigue and inertia</strong>, my
          energy—fueled by sleep, nutrition, and training—became suspicious. I
          moved fast, lifted heavy, stayed alert. Others resented that. It felt
          absurd to be <strong>whispered about simply for being alive</strong>.
        </p>

        <h2 id="culture-evasion">Culture of Evasion</h2>

        <p>
          Evasion doesn’t scream. It whispers. Contracts unsigned, slips
          delayed, trails erased. Everything is there — just never all at once.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>1. Missing documents, missing responsibilities.</b>
          No onboarding papers. Payslips delayed, partial, or absent. When
          pressure comes, nothing formal can be held.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>2. Accounting opacity as method.</b>
          External accounting firms issue neutral slips — 3 lines, no context.
          Details fade: no overtime, no tax logic, no breakdowns. Visibility is
          optional.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>3. Bankruptcy as exit strategy.</b>
          When claims rise, structures collapse. Companies fold, partners
          vanish, and no one stays accountable. It’s not disappearance — it’s a
          reset.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>4. Hidden ownership, offshore instincts.</b>
          Ownership passes through wives, brothers, or ghost firms. Sometimes
          offshore, always unnamed. Secrecy isn’t the tactic — it’s the
          framework.
        </p>

        <h2>Standing My Ground</h2>
        <p>
          In the early months, a server tried to boss me around. I drew a line:
          I belonged to the kitchen, not the floor. The manager pulled me
          aside—not to shout, but to warn. I adapted. I
          <strong>learned the hierarchy</strong>. And I stayed 14 months.
