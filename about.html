            I analyze operational dysfunctions inside companies: unclear
            authority, decision gridlocks, delayed actions. I map where systems
            leak money, waste time, or dilute execution power.

          <h3>Current Focus</h3>
          <p>
            I target overlooked SMEs in complex sectors (hospitality, logistics,
            tech-enabled services) where
            <strong>local decisions contradict board assumptions</strong>.

        <h2>Background</h2>

        <p>
          From <strong>16 to 19</strong>, I lived under France's welfare system.
          At 19, I started working and moved from job to job, without goal or
          pressure. It was a phase of <u>inertia and normality</u> — no
          ambition, just freedom. At <strong>23</strong> I was studying English
          at Paris-Nanterre University while taking an introductory Dutch
          course.
        </p>

        <p>
          At <strong>25</strong> while living in Vichy I met a German woman on
          an intensive French course who invited me for a brief holiday; the
          visit stretched to about eight months, during which I mainly worked on
          a construction site and also taught French. In Mannheim I felt no
          hostile or curious looks — only
          <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0"
            >the freedom of being an ordinary person</mark
          >.
        </p>

        <p>
          From that time I realized that
          <strong>living abroad would become part of my journey</strong>. It
          revealed new opportunities, and
          <u>returning home became merely a brief pause</u> before I set off
          again to explore fresh perspectives. This mobility taught me to spot
          patterns across different systems and cultures.

        <h2>How I Think About Investment</h2>

        <p>
          At <strong>32</strong>, after the 2008 crisis, I began questioning how
          systems actually work versus how they claim to work. I spent years
          decoding <strong>political and economic structures</strong> until I
          understood how consent gets manufactured and
          <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0"
            >where the real decision-making happens</mark
          >. This same pattern recognition now applies to business analysis.
        </p>

        <p>
          At <strong>37</strong>, I flew to Hong Kong with
          <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0">€50 in cash</mark>, no plan,
          no booking. Stayed 8 months testing what might unfold with minimal
          resources. <u>First attempt at entering business from nothing</u> —
          taught me how to operate with constraints while maintaining strategic
          clarity.
        </p>
        <p>
          I moved to <strong>Ireland</strong> in 2019 — the
          <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Irish_arrangement"
            class="subtle-link"
            >Silicon Valley of EU tech support</a
          >. It was a natural relaunch zone after Asia, with hundreds of roles
          in top-tier call centers. I got
          <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0"
            >multiple interviews at
            <a href="#" class="note-link">FAANG</a></mark
          >
          — but failed to convert.
        </p>

        <p>
          Too senior, too independent, I didn’t fit the mold. Instead, I focused
          on fundamentals: <strong>web development</strong>,
          <strong>low-level C</strong>, and basic algorithms. By 2021, as
          <u>Covid restrictions were lifted</u>, I was ready to move.
        </p>
        <p>
          In <strong>2021</strong>, after 3 years in <strong>Ireland</strong>, I
          booked a one-way flight to
          <a
            href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LwZOYkruenzI7NelJh5O5Ro87yPblRyB/view?usp=sharing"
            class="file-link"
            >Norway</a
          >
          to escape, but was
          <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0">denied entry</mark> after one
          week in custody — likely due to
          <span class="note-link">Covid status</span> and
          <span class="note-link">lack of clear purpose</span>. Authorities paid
          my return to
          <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Nice" class="subtle-link"
            >Nice</a
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2022, I moved to Sweden and worked 14 months in Stockholm
          restaurant operations, analyzing organizational patterns from inside
          high-volume kitchens while earning up to 28,000 SEK monthly."
        </p>
        <p>
          The logic is simple:
          <strong
            >official documents lie, financial statements lie, org charts
            lie</strong
          >
          — but operational behavior patterns always tell the truth. I map
          actual power structures, identify where resources flow inefficiently,
          and find
          <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0"
            >leverage points where small changes create disproportionate
            results</mark
          >.

        <h2>Business Evolution</h2>

        <p>
          I never liked the word "startup." What fascinated me was
          <strong>venture creation logic</strong> — building something new with
          full creative freedom in uncertainty and high asymmetry. I wanted
          <u>leverage without permission</u>, a way to test ideas, own the
          upside, and stay free. It wasn't about innovation — it was about
          <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0"
            >wealth creation through controlled chaos</mark
          >.
        </p>

        <p>
          From <strong>40 onward</strong>, I became radically intentional about
          everything — location, relationships, projects. I select for
          <u>compatibility with my direction</u> and elimination of friction.
          Tech allows remote work, low entry barriers, and upward optionality —
          perfect for maintaining
          <strong>autonomy while building leverage</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Now I'm shifting from
          <strong>building companies to buying them</strong>. Better to analyze
          existing operations, identify structural problems, and apply targeted
          fixes than start from zero. Most acquisition opportunities fail
          because buyers focus on growth projections instead of
          <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0"
            >fixing what's obviously broken</mark
          >.

        <h2>Current Investment Focus</h2>

        <p>
          I'm shifting from <strong>building companies to buying them</strong>.
          Better to analyze existing operations, identify structural problems,
          and apply targeted fixes than start from zero. Most acquisition
          opportunities fail because buyers focus on growth projections instead
          of
          <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0"

          >.
        </p>

        <p>
          My investment thesis:
          <strong
            >small companies with authority dysfunction create massive arbitrage
            opportunities</strong
          >. Clear up decision-making, eliminate operational bottlenecks, fix
          cash flow timing — often worth more than the asking price. Traditional
          buyers miss this because they're
          <u
            >looking at spreadsheets instead of watching actual behavior
            patterns</u
          >.
        </p>

        <p>
          Each analysis gets documented and feeds back into
          <strong>methodology refinement</strong>. I'm building pattern
          libraries for rapid assessment — recognizing recurring dysfunction
          types across industries and knowing which interventions actually work.
          This isn't academic research — it's
          <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0"
            >pattern recognition for practical value creation</mark
          >.

        <h2>Why This Platform Exists</h2>

        <p>
          This site documents my
          <strong>investment research methodology</strong> through real case
          analysis. It's both a case study repository and a methodology
          development lab. Everything here demonstrates
          <u>how I actually think about companies</u> when considering
          acquisition or operational improvement opportunities.
        </p>

        <p>
          I share this because
          <strong>pattern recognition improves with transparency</strong>. Other
          people spot things I miss, challenge assumptions, or point out blind
          spots. The goal isn't to be right about everything — it's to build
          <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0"
            >increasingly accurate models for value creation
            identification</mark
          >
          in real business contexts.
