              Statement</strong
            >
          </summary>

          <p>
            This section formalizes the mindset that governed my exit: not a
            failure, but an act of alignment. It explains why I chose dignity
            over endurance, and inner coherence over passive compliance.
          </p>

          <p>
            In the field of labour law, this qualifies as a
            <strong>Statement of Grounds</strong>: a motivated justification
            explaining the rational and ethical logic behind a voluntary
            departure under moral strain.
          </p>

          <p>
            It also falls within the tradition of
            <strong>Operating Principles</strong> as used by entrepreneurs and
            creators — from Naval Ravikant to Philippe Guillement — where action
            is dictated by resonance, not repetition.
          </p>

          <p>
            In my case, risk-taking was not recklessness. It was the only way to
            preserve momentum, clarity, and direction. Remaining would have
            meant dissonance, collapse, and toxic assimilation.
          </p>

          <p>
            My decision to leave was based on years of introspective discipline,
            exposure to metaphysical thinking, and a conscious rejection of
            environments that obstruct future probabilities.
          </p>

          <p>
            This is not a manifesto. It is a legal and personal record of
            coherence: a structured refusal to allow short-term dysfunction to
            hijack long-term integrity.

      <p>
        My name is <strong>Patrice Kenmoé</strong>, I’m 47 years old. Born in
        <strong>Lyon</strong>, of
        <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bamileke_people"
          class="subtle-link"
          >Bamiléké</a
        >s ethnicity, I’ve lived in six countries.
      </p>

      <p>
        From <strong>16 to 19</strong>, I lived under France’s welfare system.
        At <strong>19</strong>, I started working and moved from job to job,
        without goal or pressure.. It was a phase of inertia and normality — no
        ambition, just freedom.
      </p>

      <p>
        At <strong>23</strong> I was studying English at
        <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Nanterre_University"
          class="subtle-link"
          >Paris-Nanterre</a
        >University while taking an introductory Dutch course. I replied to a
        Dutch student's home-swap offer, living in her Amsterdam room while she
        stayed in my studio near Paris.
      </p>
      <p>
        Around that age, I was looking for a
        <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0">manual for life</mark> and
        triggered by
        <a href="https://www.technicart.com" class="subtle-link">Technikart</a>,
        I started reading 3 to 4 books a month — essays, modern novels,
        postmodern philosophy.
      </p>

      <p>
        At <strong>25</strong> while living in Vichy I met a German woman on an
        intensive French course who invited me for a brief holiday; the visit
        stretched to about eight months, during which I mainly worked on a
        construction site and also taught French.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Mannheim I felt no hostile or curious looks—only the freedom of being
        an ordinary person. Surrounded by well-travelled, open people, I was
        viewed in conversation as an articulate, intelligent Frenchman rather
        than through a “Black” label.
      </p>

      <p>
        From that time I realised that
        <u><strong>living abroad would become part of my journey</strong></u
        >: it revealed <u>new opportunities</u>, and
        <u>returning home</u> became merely a brief pause before I set off again
        to <u>explore fresh perspectives</u>.
      </p>

        />
      </div>

      <p>
        At <strong>27</strong> I returned to the Netherlands and worked in
        several call centres. Nearing thirty (age 28) I began IT training to
        give my career structure.
      </p>

      <p>
        At <strong>29</strong> I was hired by HP me near Barcelona before I had
        even finished the course.
      </p>
      <p>
        From the <strong>very first weeks</strong>, I felt a deep sense of
        <strong>alienation</strong>. I had set a clear objective:
        <strong>5 continuous years in IT</strong>, to
        <strong>build a solid CV</strong> in the
        <u>absence of college degree</u>. I spent
        <strong>2.5 years abroad</strong> in operational roles, then
        <strong>2 years in Paris</strong> working in <u>tech services</u>.
      </p>

      <p>
        At 34, I was on a <strong>peak trajectory</strong>. But without
        <strong>responsibilities</strong>, I had no reason to endure more. Had I
        stayed, I would have fallen into

          quiet desperation
        </a>
        , where <u>suffering ends up expelled</u> as <strong>violence</strong>.
        So I stepped away — no drama, no ties..

      <p>
        At 34, I’d reached my <strong>peak trajectory</strong> — highest pay,
        best title, no real strings. But beneath it: <em>quiet desperation</em>,
        grinding fatigue, a creeping sense of collapse. So I stepped away — no
        drama, no ties.

      <h2>35–45 sequence</h2>

      <p>
        <strong>In 2012</strong>, I entered what I would later call my
        <strong>35–45 sequence</strong>: a phase of <strong>rejection</strong> —
        first of the <strong>corporate world</strong>, then the
        <strong>welfare state</strong>. My first move was
        <strong>Berlin</strong>, driven by a search for <u>peace of mind</u>,
        away from <u>status games</u> and <u>toxic patterns</u>.

      <p></p>
      <p>
        At <strong>32</strong>, right after the <strong>2008 crisis</strong>, I
        began <strong>questioning the structures of power</strong>.
      </p>

      <h2><mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0">Power Structures</mark></h2>

      <p>
        Before any “growth,” I had already begun reading extensively on
        <u>geopolitics</u>, <u>economic systems</u>, and
        <u>power structures</u> during my final years in France I needed to
        <strong>understand the architecture of constraint</strong>. As early as
        <strong>age 33</strong>, I had already started to decode the
        <strong>political, economic and social architecture</strong> around me —
        the first axis of thought I would later define as
        <strong>System Decryption</strong>.. I spent years decoding power
        systems—politics, media, finance, welfare—until I saw how consent was
        manufactured. It wasn’t paranoia. It was self-defense.

      <p>
        I didn’t want guidance. I wanted to
        <strong>build my own compass</strong>. I believed there had to be a
        way—through reading, trial, and structure—to design a protocol for life.
        I wasn’t looking for spiritual peace. I was looking for
        <u>clarity, autonomy, and inner leverage</u>.

        </h2>
        <p>
          I never liked the word “startup.” What fascinated me was the logic of
          <strong>venture creation</strong>: building something radically new,
          with full creative freedom, in a space of uncertainty and high
          asymmetry. I wanted <strong>leverage without permission</strong>—a way
          to test ideas, own the upside, and stay free. It wasn’t just about
          innovation. It was about
          <u>the possibility of wealth through chaos</u>.
        </p>
        <section id="heuristic-alignment">
          <p>
            <strong>Heuristic Logic</strong> — Some of my choices were shaped by
            <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0"
              >Naval’s decision heuristics</mark
            >, others were my own. I credit him especially on
            <u>location and peace of mind</u>. His lens helped me turn instinct
            into structure.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>What I do</strong> — I chose <u>tech</u> because it allowed
            remote work, low entry friction, and upward optionality. I wasn’t
            passionate at first. But it felt like a
            <strong>survival heuristic</strong> that fit my life constraints.
            Later, I followed projects that gave me
            <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0">mental clarity</mark>, not
            just income.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Where I live</strong> — After Hong Kong, I
            <strong>never returned to the same country twice</strong>. That’s my
            own rule. Naval helped me sharpen it:
            <u>location defines trajectory</u>. Singapour isn’t just a place —
            it’s a conscious bet on social relief, business frictionlessness,
            and clean structure.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Who I’m with</strong> — From 40 onward, I became radically
            intentional in relationships. I select for
            <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0"
              >compatibility with my direction</mark
            >. Before, it was inertia. Now it’s projection. <u>Sara</u> was a
            turning point — I’ll link that fragment soon.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>My own heuristics</strong> —
            <em>If it’s easy, it’s wrong</em>.
            <em>Choose change over comfort</em>. And
            <strong
              >never endure long-term toxicity for short-term safety</strong
            >. That’s what led me to leave well-paying jobs, cut ties fast, and
            avoid systems that erode clarity.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Entrepreneurship</strong> — For me, it's not ambition. It’s
            a <u>peace strategy</u>. I needed out of the salary maze, and into
            focus-based leverage. I saw work not as status — but as structure.

        <p>
          At <strong> 40</strong>, that shift led me to Stockholm where I
          started my first serious tech venture.

        </p>

        <p>
          At <strong>41</strong>, , I landed in <strong>Stockholm</strong> with
          little plan—homeless but driven. I was coming out of months of
          personal disarray, and for the first time, two desires emerged
          clearly:
          <span class="highlight">starting a family or starting a company</span
          >.
        </p>

        <p>
          That’s where I met <strong>Léo</strong> at a startup incubator. We
          co-founded a tech project. Though I lacked technical skills, the
          effort
