      <section class="narrative-intro">
        <p>
          This part continues the <em>narrative grid</em> â€” a pragmatic label
          for a three-part structure used to examine how a conflict was shaped
          through its early framing, internal operations, and implicit power
          dynamics.
        </p>

        <details open>
          <summary class="section-order">
            ðŸ”„ <strong>Part 2 â€” Process Narrative</strong>
          </summary>

          <p>
            <strong>Function:</strong> This section reconstructs how work
            actually unfolded â€” who gave instructions, who took charge, and how
            roles shifted beyond official titles or contracts.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Fields:</strong> Known as a
            <strong>process narrative</strong> (HR),
            <strong>functional ethnography</strong> (sociology), or
            <strong>workflow mapping</strong> (audit). All describe how systems
            operate below the surface.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Usage:</strong> Used by compliance officers, workplace
            mediators, and researchers to clarify informal routines, relational
            tensions, and decision patterns that donâ€™t appear in formal
            hierarchies.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Adaptation:</strong> This section captures how fragmented
            authority and social silences shaped daily life. It tracks where
            guidance came from, who avoided responsibility, and how staff
            compensated through informal channels.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Structure:</strong> The narrative follows a chronological
            logic, grounded in first-person memory and interaction flow. It
            prioritizes lived routines over documentation.
          </p>

      <p>
        Quan operates physically within the premises of Elite Hotel Esplanade,
        at MÃ¤ster Johansgatan 15 in MalmÃ¶. While customers often believe they
        are dealing directly with hotel staff,
        <strong
          >the restaurant is managed independently, under separate legal
          entities</strong
        >.
      </p>

      <p>
        The integration is <strong>logistical rather than visual</strong>: Quan
        shares the physical space of the hotel, but
        <strong
          >employment and managerial responsibilities are externalized to
          private companies</strong
        >
        with no direct affiliation to the Elite Hotels group.
      </p>

      <p>
        When I first considered applying at Quan, I conducted a standard
        ownership check to tailor my motivation email.
        <strong
          >Henrik Kei Siebert was the only visible public figure linked to the
          restaurant</strong
        >, repeatedly cited in hotel communications and online articles as its
        founder.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong
          >No trace of a distinct legal entity operating Quan appeared in public
          records</strong
        >, which left me uncertain about whom to addressâ€”and forced me to send a
        generic, unpersonalized message.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Sahar was only present two or three days a week</strong>, and
        when she was there, she acted as a
        <strong>stressed-out waitress, not a manager</strong>, unavailable, and
        never proactively communicative.
      </p>

      <p>
        I was never invited to discuss my role or expectations. I was just a
        dishwasher, and she was the boss.
        <strong>She never introduced herself</strong>. .
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>From the outset</strong>, I quickly realised I had no clear
        point of contact.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>She never asked me how I was doing</strong>.I never received an
        invitation to discuss problems or expectations with her.
        <strong>She gave me basic instructions</strong>â€”such as keeping the
        hotel corridor cleanâ€”but
        <strong>never engaged in any managerial dialogue</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Henrik (the chef)</strong> gave me practical instructions early
        on, like where to put the trash and where to get cleaning supplies. He
        was courteous, distant but always respectful.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Sub-chefs quickly showed limits</strong>. They helped with small
        tasks but their body language made it clear not to insist. I stopped
        asking them anything beyond essentials.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>So I stopped trying</strong>. I started talking more with the
        waiters. With a few exceptions,
        <strong>they were helpful and pleasant</strong>. The general vibe was
        good. People seemed happy to be there.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>There was laughter, music, a sense of energy</strong>. Even if
        Sahar created some tension sometimes (like firing a waitress in front of
        me), the team was mostly upbeat. I believe this was largely due to good
        salaries. One bartender even told me this was the best opportunity heâ€™d
        found after years in the field.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Only the waiters were approachable</strong>, mostly kind and
        supportive. There was a generally good atmosphere among staffâ€”many
        seemed happy, possibly due to decent pay and tips.
      </p>

      <p>
        I had <strong>no HR, no staff coordinator</strong>, and no one in a
        defined role to address workplace questions. The entire structure ran on
        proxy and inference.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>The result was clear: I had to manage on my own</strong>. I
        needed answers, but found no one to ask. Eventually I emailed the
        restaurant directly. No one contested this, but I could tell
        <strong>it wasnâ€™t how things were supposed to be done</strong>. They had
        been looking for a dishwasher for months. I got positive feedback from
        many coworkers. Several told me I was doing a great job.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Henrik, the co-gerant, was polite but distant</strong>. We
        exchanged maybe three words in three weeks. He showed interest in the
        music I listened to once, and thatâ€™s how I learned he spoke Japanese.
        <strong>He never introduced himself</strong>. Everything else I learned
        about him came from colleagues.
        <strong>At no point could I tell he had any managerial role</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        I tried to reach Sahar by email after an incident with cleaners I hadnâ€™t
        been informed about. Her response confirmed the vague structure:
        <strong
          >I was offered to replace them, as if this was a known path</strong
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >The management triangle (Sahar, Henrik, and the co-manager)</strong
        >
        was disconnected. They rarely spoke. I never once saw Sahar and Henrik
        (co-gÃ©rant) interact or stand side-by-side.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over time, I learned
        <strong>Sahar was married to the founder</strong>, who was best friends
        with Henrik. This <strong>lack of shared leadership</strong> permeated
        the workplace and made me rely on trial-and-error and informal channels
        to understand my role.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was only after a few days on site that I discovered the restaurant
        was legally operated by <strong>HSSC Event AB</strong>â€”not Quan, nor
        Elite Hotel. The name appeared in the internal scheduling platform
        <strong>Personalkollen</strong>, which employees used to access shift
        information.
      </p>

      <p>
        Despite this, <strong>quanbyquan.se</strong> has been actively used for
        internal communication. At least four domain-linked emails were
        confirmed as active: hs, se, hk, and <strong>sc@quanbyquan.se</strong>.
        Delivery receipts confirm messages reached these recipients.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Henrik Kei Sieber</strong>, publicly introduced as the lead
        figure behind Quan, maintained a
        <strong>discreet yet regular presence</strong>. I observed him working
        no more than two to three days a week, typically welcoming guests and
        overseeing the front-of-house with focused attention.
      </p>

      <p>
        Two chefs, <strong>Robin Albay Dinopol</strong> and
        <strong>Satoru Yoshizawa</strong>, who were regularly scheduled on
        evening shifts, were later identified as the sole partners of
        <strong>BURI Handelsbolag</strong> (org.nr 969798-6447). Their company
        is not listed as a subcontractor, but they both worked onsite as cooks.
      </p>

      <p>
        This configuration raises the possibility of
        <strong>undeclared subcontracting</strong>, where staff are employed
        through a third-party vehicle without formal declaration. No document or
        contract was disclosed to clarify the terms of their engagement with
        Quan or HSSC Event AB.
      </p>

      <p>
        Another <strong>external subcontractor</strong> was regularly observed
        on site every Friday night. A cleaning couple arrived at approximately
        <strong>23:30</strong> and remained on site until around
        <strong>04:00</strong>, working four hours each.
      </p>

      <p>
        Their presence accounted for a total of
        <strong>eight hours per session</strong>. They were not listed on any
        official schedule, and no company name or contractual arrangement was
        ever disclosed. Management suggested I might be asked to
        <strong>replace them</strong> due to dissatisfaction with their work.
