        <h1>Working Dynamics</h1>

        <!-- Ton contenu Working Dynamics ici -->

        <p>
          <strong>Sahar was only present two or three days a week</strong>, and
          when she was there, she acted as a
          <strong>stressed-out waitress, not a manager</strong>, unavailable,
          and never proactively communicative.
        </p>

        <p>
          I was never invited to discuss my role or expectations. I was just a
          dishwasher, and she was the boss.
          <strong>She never introduced herself</strong>. .
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>From the outset</strong>, I quickly realised I had no clear
          point of contact.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>She never asked me how I was doing</strong>.I never received
          an invitation to discuss problems or expectations with her.
          <strong>She gave me basic instructions</strong>—such as keeping the
          hotel corridor clean—but
          <strong>never engaged in any managerial dialogue</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Henrik (the chef)</strong> gave me practical instructions
          early on, like where to put the trash and where to get cleaning
          supplies. He was courteous, distant but always respectful.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Sub-chefs quickly showed limits</strong>. They helped with
          small tasks but their body language made it clear not to insist. I
          stopped asking them anything beyond essentials.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>So I stopped trying</strong>. I started talking more with the
          waiters. With a few exceptions,
          <strong>they were helpful and pleasant</strong>. The general vibe was
          good. People seemed happy to be there.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>There was laughter, music, a sense of energy</strong>. Even if
          Sahar created some tension sometimes (like firing a waitress in front
          of me), the team was mostly upbeat. I believe this was largely due to
          good salaries. One bartender even told me this was the best
          opportunity he’d found after years in the field.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Only the waiters were approachable</strong>, mostly kind and
          supportive. There was a generally good atmosphere among staff—many
          seemed happy, possibly due to decent pay and tips.
        </p>

        <p>
          I had <strong>no HR, no staff coordinator</strong>, and no one in a
          defined role to address workplace questions. The entire structure ran
          on proxy and inference.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>The result was clear: I had to manage on my own</strong>. I
          needed answers, but found no one to ask. Eventually I emailed the
          restaurant directly. No one contested this, but I could tell
          <strong>it wasn’t how things were supposed to be done</strong>. They
          had been looking for a dishwasher for months. I got positive feedback
          from many coworkers. Several told me I was doing a great job.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Henrik, the co-gerant, was polite but distant</strong>. We
          exchanged maybe three words in three weeks. He showed interest in the
          music I listened to once, and that’s how I learned he spoke Japanese.
          <strong>He never introduced himself</strong>. Everything else I
          learned about him came from colleagues.
          <strong>At no point could I tell he had any managerial role</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          I tried to reach Sahar by email after an incident with cleaners I
          hadn’t been informed about. Her response confirmed the vague
          structure:
          <strong
            >I was offered to replace them, as if this was a known path</strong
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong
            >The management triangle (Sahar, Henrik, and the co-manager)</strong
          >
          was disconnected. They rarely spoke. I never once saw Sahar and Henrik
          (co-gérant) interact or stand side-by-side.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over time, I learned
          <strong>Sahar was married to the founder</strong>, who was best
          friends with Henrik. This
          <strong>lack of shared leadership</strong> permeated the workplace and
          made me rely on trial-and-error and informal channels to understand my
          role.
