      <section class="narrative-intro">
        <p>
          This part continues the <em>narrative grid</em> ‚Äî a pragmatic label
          for a three-part structure used to examine how a conflict was shaped
          through its early framing, internal operations, and implicit power
          dynamics.
        </p>

          <summary class="section-order">
            üîÑ <strong>Part 2 ‚Äî Process Narrative</strong>
          </summary>

          <p>
            <strong>Function:</strong> This section reconstructs how work
            actually unfolded ‚Äî who gave instructions, who took charge, and how
            roles shifted beyond official titles or contracts.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Fields:</strong> Known as a
            <strong>process narrative</strong> (HR),
            <strong>functional ethnography</strong> (sociology), or
            <strong>workflow mapping</strong> (audit). All describe how systems
            operate below the surface.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Usage:</strong> Used by compliance officers, workplace
            mediators, and researchers to clarify informal routines, relational
            tensions, and decision patterns that don‚Äôt appear in formal
            hierarchies.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Adaptation:</strong> This section captures how fragmented
            authority and social silences shaped daily life. It tracks where
            guidance came from, who avoided responsibility, and how staff
            compensated through informal channels.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Structure:</strong> The narrative follows a chronological
            logic, grounded in first-person memory and interaction flow. It
            prioritizes lived routines over documentation.
          </p>

        This section tracks <strong>informal routines</strong>,
        <strong>real-time delegation</strong>, and
        <strong>friction points</strong> between official roles and daily
        execution. It complements
        <a href="/signals.html" class="subtle-link">Perceived Authority</a> by
        focusing not on titles, but on <u>who actually did what</u>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The section opens with three core figures:
        <strong>Sahar</strong> (informal lead),
        <strong>Henrik</strong> (co-manager, mostly silent), and
        <strong>Saahil</strong> (strategic but invisible).
      </p>

      <p>
        Around them,
        <a href="#" class="subtle-link"
          >two groups absorbed daily friction: kitchen sub-leads and waiters</a
        >. What follows maps
        <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0"
          >who gave orders, who mediated, and who stayed silent</mark
        >.

      <h2>üß© A Leadership Duo That Never Spoke</h2>
      <p>
        <u>I never saw Sahar and Henrik speak or coordinate ‚Äî not once</u>. Not
        during rush hours, not at shift change, not even at social events.
        <strong>They acted as if the other didn't exist</strong>. It puzzled me.
        I'd seen what business entanglements between partners can do ‚Äî and this
        silence felt like a warning sign.
      </p>

      <h2>üßΩ The Empty Chair ‚Äî Dishwasher Legacy</h2>
      <p>
        After the departure of a <strong>70-year-old veteran</strong> ‚Äî said to
        have <a href="#" class="subtle-link">12 years in the company</a> ‚Äî staff
        tried hiring <strong>4 to 6 replacements</strong>.
        <u>None stayed long</u>. The comparison to him was constant:
        <strong>fast, loyal, tireless</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        I was welcomed with <strong>relief and curiosity</strong>.
        <u>Quentin spoke of a string of failures</u> ‚Äî some via
        <a href="#" class="subtle-link">temp agencies</a>, others quitting last
        minute. The role had become <strong>unstable, fragile, exposed</strong>.
        No dishwasher lasted. <u>All disengaged</u>.
      </p>

      <h2>üì° Waiters as Relay Nodes</h2>
      <p>
        Every real answer came from the floor team. Quentin, especially,
        <strong>acted as de facto coordinator</strong>. He knew what others
        wouldn‚Äôt say. Even when he distanced himself later,
        <u>he remained my only anchor</u>. I never asked anything from the
        sous-chefs ‚Äî not because I didn‚Äôt want to, but because
        <strong>they were never available</strong>.
      </p>

      <h2>ü§ù Human Signals, Not Titles</h2>
      <p>
        Robin and Satoru‚Äôs gestures ‚Äî quiet, generous, unforced ‚Äî stayed with
        me. They were the ones who
        <u>shared food, covered gaps, asked questions</u>. And yet, they had no
        role in management.
        <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0"
          >The hierarchy was cold; the warmth came from its edges</mark
        >.
      </p>

      <div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 20px">
        <img
          src="./assets/img/sel.jpg"
          alt="Overflow"
          style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 8px"
        />
      </div>

      <p>
        <u><strong>Sahar</strong> welcomed me on day one</u>. She was presented
        as the boss, gave me the rules, and said Henrik would follow up if
        needed. I quickly learned she only showed up
        <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0">two to three days a week</mark>
        ‚Äî each appearance felt exceptional. No onboarding, no role description,
        no link to anyone beyond her. <strong>She gave the orders</strong>, but
        always from a distance.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Henrik appeared even less often</strong> ‚Äî one or two days a
        week. As part of my usual brief
        <span style="text-decoration: underline">due diligence</span>, I had
        researched the restaurant‚Äôs structure. He was the
        <strong>only public figure</strong> tied to the venue:
        <a
          href="https://www.travelnews.se/hotell/henrik-siebert-oppnar-krog-i-elite-hotel-adlon-i-malmo/"
          class="subtle-link"
          >link</a
        >. But I wasn‚Äôt yet familiar with corporate genealogies in the F&B
        industry. I saw no red flags, just standard PR. So I wrote a standard
        cover letter and moved on.
      </p>

      <p>
        Yet when we met,
        <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0"
          >he didn‚Äôt introduce himself</mark
        >. We never talked. No handshake. No onboarding. No greetings.
        <strong>Just badge handovers</strong> ‚Äî no eye contact, no hostility, no
        engagement. Always
        <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0"
          >neutral, reserved, and distant</mark
        >. I assumed cultural reserve.
      </p>

      <p>
        The only verbal exchange I remember: I was listening to
        <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Jarrett"
          class="subtle-link"
          >Keith Jarrett</a
        >
        while working. Henrik asked who it was. I showed him the
        <a
          href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SD5WnfgiPUk&t=69s"
          class="subtle-link"
          >album cover</a
        >, and he translated the title. He was <strong>curious</strong>,
        <strong>friendly</strong>, and brief.
      </p>

      <p>
        From day one,
        <u>I was given no onboarding, no role chart, no fallback contact</u
        >.Everything passed through proxy. Sahar named Henrik as my point of
        contact, and gave me
        <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0">only his phone number</mark>.
        That alone signaled the structure: <strong>no HR, no protocol</strong>.
        When I called him on a Sunday, he replied coldly:
        <em>‚ÄúCall me Monday.‚Äù</em> I had no way to reach the sous-chefs or Sahar
        if something went wrong. My only connection to management was limited,
        delayed, and fragile.
      </p>

      <p>
        Inside the kitchen,
        <strong
          >Mathias and his co-sous-chef ran the brigade like a protected
          sphere</strong
        >. Both were cordial but cold, absorbed in tasks, and
        <u>resisted unsolicited dialogue</u>. I tried once or twice ‚Äî their
        faces shut it down.
        <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0"
          >Beyond basic logistics, I was expected to stay in my lane</mark
        >. The dishwasher role was structurally separate ‚Äî no one said it, but
        everything signaled it.

        <h2>‚öôÔ∏è Disjoint Roles & Informal Anchors</h2>

        <p>
          <u><strong>Henrik Kling</strong>, head chef</u>, was my only official
          contact ‚Äî yet we barely spoke.
          <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0"
            >No onboarding, no HR, just a phone number</mark
          >. When I texted him on a Sunday, he replied: ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs talk all this
          tomorrow, face to face. Have a great Sunday.‚Äù It revealed employee
          mindset ‚Äî courteous but off-duty. My schedule often came last-minute.
          Despite that, I received early praise and autonomy. He asked me to
          replace the cleaning subcontractor ‚Äî a task usually outsourced. I was
          told: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll be our main guy.‚Äù
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Henrik (head chef)</strong> gave me basic practical tips:
          where to throw trash, where to find supplies. Always distant, always
          respectful.
        </p>

        <p>

            ><strong>Quentin</strong> ‚Äî a French waiter ‚Äî became my real point

          reached out first, explained the rules, and gave clarity.
          <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0"
            >He answered what management avoided</mark
          >. I learned from him about shift culture, hierarchy, and tip
          expectations. In a place where even senior staff avoided engagement,
          he filled the gap.

        <h2>Sahar‚Äôs Front Role</h2>

        <p>
          <u>Sahar was introduced as the boss</u>, ran my interview, and
          <strong>gave no title</strong>. No one ever named her role. She showed
          up <strong>2‚Äì3 days a week</strong> ‚Äî always sudden, always distant.
          <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0"
            >No email, no phone, no onboarding.</mark
          >
        </p>

        <p>
          Instructions were <strong>one-way only</strong>: clean this corridor,
          replace cleaners, nothing more. <u>No feedback requested</u>, no open
          dialogue. Her posture stayed fixed:
          <strong>observe, judge, disappear</strong>. No check-ins, no small
          talk, no casual engagement.
        </p>

        <p>
          <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0"
            >Every look carried quiet judgment</mark
          >
          ‚Äî sometimes toward what I ate, or how long I stayed. Once, she asked a
          waiter to translate a basic clarification. I had worked in English for
          over ten years. <strong>I felt insulted</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0"
            >No WhatsApp, no written protocol, no fallback channel</mark
          >. The only contact was Henrik‚Äôs number. When I asked for clarity, she
          often <strong>deflected or vanished</strong>. On rare occasions, she
          responded with short neutral phrases.
        </p>

        <p>
          Her presence suggested
          <a

            class="subtle-link"
            >parental overload</a
          >: unclear priorities, emotional drain, no room for staff dialogue.
          Interactions felt one-sided.
          <u>She responded to expressions, not questions</u>.
        </p>

        <p>
          On that evening, I was struck by a mix of
          <span class="highlight">anxiety</span>, <strong>impunity</strong>, and
          a form of <u>adolescent insolence</u>‚Äîopenly assumed and left
          unchecked‚Äîthat deeply puzzled me. It triggered a kind of
          <strong>electroshock</strong>, a confrontation, and a forced
          conversation to bring clarity I never had.
        </p>
      </section>

      <p>
        <u>Henrik Kling showed up two to three times a week</u>. Always polite,
        sometimes warm ‚Äî but
        <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0"
          >never available for actual conversation</mark
        >. In the open kitchen, he played his role: brigade focus, client-facing
        calm. We exchanged nods, quick logistics, and once or twice,
        <strong>he told me: ‚ÄúI see what you do ‚Äî good work‚Äù</strong>. It
        mattered.
      </p>

      <p>
        Yet he wasn‚Äôt a decision-maker.
        <strong>He absorbed feedback but rarely gave answers</strong>. When I
        asked things, he‚Äôd say: ‚ÄúI‚Äôll talk to Sahar.‚Äù I never knew if the
        message reached her. <u>He felt like a buffer, not a boss</u>. In a team
        where even ‚Äúthank you‚Äù was rare, his few words stood out ‚Äî but changed
        nothing.

      <h2>üçΩÔ∏è Sous-chefs and Soft Gatekeeping</h2>

      <p>
        They weren‚Äôt <strong>bad actors</strong>, but they were
        <strong>fully installed</strong> ‚Äî moving inside a
        <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0"
          >settled system of quiet inertia</mark
        >. Each sub-chef managed his post like a mini-domain:
        <strong>available for basics</strong>, but clearly resistant to any
        broader dialogue. Their <u>body language</u> made it known ‚Äî
        <a href="#" class="subtle-link">no questions, no extras</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0">Nothing was hostile</mark>. They
        helped when I asked, they showed me the machines, they gave directions.
        But <strong>ask three questions</strong> and the atmosphere changed:
        <u>eye rolls, sighs, silence</u>. It wasn‚Äôt personal ‚Äî just a gate that
        stayed politely half-closed. Each interaction felt like a negotiation of
        space.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then, <u>one night changed everything</u>: I had to leave early for
        Stockholm. The whole kitchen staff ‚Äî
        <strong>including both sub-chefs</strong> ‚Äî jumped in.
        <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0"
          >Without a word, a chain reaction</mark
        >: everyone helped me close, clean, pack. That was rare.
        <strong>Unscripted solidarity</strong>. It suspended the theatre, the
        distance. And for a moment, I thought:
        <a href="#" class="subtle-link">maybe this is a place worth staying</a>.

      <h2>üë®‚Äçüç≥ Robin & Satoru ‚Äî Unexpected Warmth, Quietly Felt</h2>

      <p>
        Robin was the <strong>only kitchen staff member</strong> who
        <u>initiated casual contact</u>. He asked where I came from, how I liked
        it.
        <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0"
          >One day, I saw him covering my station</mark
        >
        ‚Äî filling in without warning. Quiet, respectful, unannounced. No one
        else ever did that.
      </p>

      <p>
        He and <a href="#" class="subtle-link">Satoru</a> stood out in the team
        ‚Äî both worked discreetly, without claiming space.
        <strong>They cooked for the team</strong>, shared food, and often
        <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0">offered premium leftovers</mark
        >. ‚ÄúYou eat a lot, right?‚Äù Robin once joked.
        <strong>Their attention felt rare</strong>, outside any formal role.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>The irony remains</em>: the <u>most human gestures</u> came from
        those <strong>outside the managerial frame</strong>. No formal
        authority, yet they offered <u>more clarity and warmth</u> than those
        who managed.

        <h2>üéØ Quentin ‚Äî The Informal Guide</h2>

        <p>
          <strong>Quentin was the only waiter</strong> who
          <u>consistently engaged</u>. He spoke <strong>French</strong>, gave
          context on
          <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0">staff routines</mark>, and
          <a href="#" class="subtle-link">translated silent rules</a>. He never
          gave me his number, but became my
          <strong>default point of contact</strong>.
          <u>Every question found its way to him</u>.
        </p>

        <p>
          His tone changed slowly ‚Äî <strong>polite but more distant</strong>. We
          never talked about life, only shifts and tasks.
          <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0"
            >No one else filled that gap</mark
          >. I sensed he had <strong>more to say</strong>, but chose not to.
          <u>He faded, but never vanished</u>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Still, his <strong>early kindness</strong> marked him out. I remember
          his calm questions, the way he explained
          <u>timing, roles, unwritten norms</u>. He often asked why I stayed
          late ‚Äî not judging, just curious. In a restaurant full of performers,
          <strong>he felt quietly grounded</strong>.

        <h2>Cleaning Shifts</h2>
        <p>
          Friday nights had a recurring ghost presence: a cleaning duo, never
          introduced, never explained. Eight hours on site. I was eventually
          asked to replace them ‚Äî no backstory, no expectations, just absorbed
          into my routine
        </p>
        <p>
          After an incident with unannounced cleaners, I contacted Sahar.
          <strong>I was offered to replace them</strong> ‚Äî no explanation, no
          background, no scope. Another silent pivot.
        </p>

        <p>
          Their presence accounted for a total of
          <strong>eight hours per session</strong>. They were not listed on any
          official schedule, and no company name or contractual arrangement was
          ever disclosed. Management suggested I might be asked to
          <strong>replace them</strong> due to dissatisfaction with their work.
