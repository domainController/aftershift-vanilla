      <p><strong>Sahar was only present two or three days a week</strong>, and when she was there, she acted as a <strong>stressed-out waitress, not a manager</strong>, unavailable, and never proactively communicative.</p>
     
      <p> I was never invited to discuss my role or expectations. I was just a dishwasher, and she was the boss. <strong>She never introduced herself</strong>. 
    .</p><p><strong>From the outset</strong>, I quickly realised I had no clear point of contact.</p>
   
      <p><strong>She never asked me how I was doing</strong>.I never received an invitation to discuss problems or expectations with her. <strong>She gave me basic instructions</strong>—such as keeping the hotel corridor clean—but <strong>never engaged in any managerial dialogue</strong>.</p>
      

      <p><strong>Henrik (the chef)</strong> gave me practical instructions early on, like where to put the trash and where to get cleaning supplies. He was courteous, distant but always respectful.</p>
        
      <p><strong>Sub-chefs quickly showed limits</strong>. They helped with small tasks but their body language made it clear not to insist. I stopped asking them anything beyond essentials.</p>
    
     
  
      <p><strong>So I stopped trying</strong>. I started talking more with the waiters. With a few exceptions, <strong>they were helpful and pleasant</strong>. The general vibe was good. People seemed happy to be there.</p>
        
        <p><strong>There was laughter, music, a sense of energy</strong>. Even if Sahar created some tension sometimes (like firing a waitress in front of me), the team was mostly upbeat. I believe this was largely due to good salaries. One bartender even told me this was the best opportunity he’d found after years in the field.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Only the waiters were approachable</strong>, mostly kind and supportive. There was a generally good atmosphere among staff—many seemed happy, possibly due to decent pay and tips.</p>

      <p>I had <strong>no HR, no staff coordinator</strong>, and no one in a defined role to address workplace questions. The entire structure ran on proxy and inference.</p>
        
      <p><strong>The result was clear: I had to manage on my own</strong>. I needed answers, but found no one to ask. Eventually I emailed the restaurant directly. No one contested this, but I could tell <strong>it wasn’t how things were supposed to be done</strong>. They had been looking for a dishwasher for months. I got positive feedback from many coworkers. Several told me I was doing a great job.</p>
      <p><strong>Henrik, the co-gerant, was polite but distant</strong>. We exchanged maybe three words in three weeks. He showed interest in the music I listened to once, and that’s how I learned he spoke Japanese. <strong>He never introduced himself</strong>. Everything else I learned about him came from colleagues. <strong>At no point could I tell he had any managerial role</strong>.</p>
      
  
      <p>I tried to reach Sahar by email after an incident with cleaners I hadn’t been informed about. Her response confirmed the vague structure: <strong>I was offered to replace them, as if this was a known path</strong>.</p>
        <p><strong>The management triangle (Sahar, Henrik, and the co-manager)</strong> was disconnected. They rarely spoke. I never once saw Sahar and Henrik (co-gérant) interact or stand side-by-side.</p>
        <p>Over  time, I learned <strong>Sahar was married to the founder</strong>, who was best friends with Henrik. This <strong>lack of shared leadership</strong> permeated the workplace and made me rely on trial-and-error and informal channels to understand my role.</p>
