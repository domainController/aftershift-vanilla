            This platform documents how I actually look at companies when
            considering acquisition. No consulting bullshit, no theoretical
            frameworks borrowed from business school. Just

              dysfunction</strong

            Financial statements are fiction. What matters is
            <strong>who really makes decisions</strong>, where the bottlenecks
            actually are, and
            <u>which operational fixes would unlock the most cash</u>. This
            isn't about perfect due diligence ‚Äî it's about

              >seeing what's broken</a
            >

        <h2>Authority Mapping ‚Äî Who Actually Runs This Thing</h2>

        <p>
          Org charts lie. The real question is
          <strong>who actually decides</strong> when something goes wrong at
          <u>2 PM on a Tuesday</u>. I trace decision patterns backwards from
          operational failures to find
          <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0"
            >the actual power structure</mark
          >. Most companies have shadow hierarchies where the person with the
          title isn't the person solving problems.
        </p>

        <p>
          Authority gaps create cash leaks. When
          <strong>nobody owns a decision</strong>, money disappears through
          delayed responses, duplicated work, and
          <u>strategic procrastination</u>. Finding these gaps early means
          knowing exactly where to apply pressure during
          <a href="/restructuring.html" class="subtle-link"
            >operational restructuring</a
          >.
        </p>

        <p>
          I map three layers: <strong>formal authority</strong> (what the
          documents say), <strong>operational authority</strong> (who people
          actually call), and
          <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0">crisis authority</mark> (who
          shows up when everything breaks). The gaps between these three layers
          predict exactly where value is being destroyed.

        <h2>Operational Bottleneck Detection</h2>

        <p>
          Every company has
          <strong>exactly three to five operational bottlenecks</strong> that
          limit growth. Finding them requires watching how information and
          decisions flow under stress. I focus on <u>timing patterns</u> rather
          than process documentation ‚Äî when things slow down, where they
          accumulate, and
          <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0"
            >which person or system consistently becomes the constraint</mark
          >.
        </p>

        <p>
          Most bottlenecks aren't technical. They're
          <strong>psychological</strong> ‚Äî someone afraid to make decisions,
          someone hoarding information, or someone who's become indispensable by
          making themselves a <u>required approval step</u>. These human
          bottlenecks often hide the biggest value creation opportunities
          because they're usually
          <a href="/governance.html" class="note-link"
            >fixable with simple authority redistribution</a
          >.
        </p>

        <p>
          Resource allocation follows bottlenecks. If
          <strong>decision-making is slow</strong>, people waste time preparing
          for meetings that don't matter. If
          <strong>information flow is constrained</strong>, teams duplicate work
          or make decisions with
          <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0">incomplete data</mark>.
          Finding the bottleneck tells you exactly where efficiency gains will
          compound.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Cash Flow Reality Check</h2>

        <p>
          Reported numbers reflect accounting decisions, not operational
          reality. I trace <strong>actual cash movements</strong> by looking at
          payment timing, vendor relationships, and
          <u>working capital patterns</u>. Companies with clean books but messy
          operations often have
          <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0"
            >hidden cash optimization opportunities</mark
          >
          worth more than their asking price.
        </p>

        <p>
          Operational improvements compound through cash cycles. Fix
          <strong>inventory turnover</strong> and working capital improves. Fix
          <strong>decision speed</strong> and customer satisfaction improves.
          Fix
          <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0">authority clarity</mark> and
          both operational efficiency and employee retention improve. Most
          buyers focus on revenue growth when
          <a href="/restructuring.html" class="subtle-link"
            >cash generation efficiency</a
          >
          offers better returns with lower risk.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Documentation Method</h2>

        <p>
          Everything gets documented in real-time during analysis.
          <strong>Pattern recognition improves with data volume</strong> ‚Äî the
          more companies I analyze, the faster I spot recurring dysfunction
          types. Each case study feeds back into
          <u>methodology refinement</u> and helps identify which
          <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0"
            >operational fixes translate across industries</mark
          >.
        </p>

        <p>
          This isn't academic research. It's
          <strong>pattern library development</strong> for practical
          application. Every documented analysis becomes a
          <u>reference point</u> for future investment decisions and operational
          improvement strategies.
