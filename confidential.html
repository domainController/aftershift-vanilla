            🍷 <strong>Semiotics of Taste</strong> — is a series of short essays
            decoding the <em>ritualised social theatre</em> of food, dining, and
            status — not just from the client’s side, but through the eyes of
            restaurateurs projecting their own aspirational mimicry. From René
            Girard’s mimetic desire to the fantasy of the
            <u>eternal weekend dinner</u>, the series explores how service
            culture, class friction, and identity rituals intersect — and how
            hospitality becomes both camouflage and fantasy for upward mobility.
