      <p>
        📄 This file is not lengthy nor dramatic — it is compact, clear, and
        evidence-driven. Its restraint is deliberate: each detail is sourced and
        hard to dismiss once read in full.
      </p>
  <ul>
  <li>📊 <strong>Strategic Comparison</strong> — Financial breakdown of Quan vs. Elite Hotel (2019–2023)</li>

  <li>🧠 <strong>Fallout-Inspired Legal Architecture</strong> — Izakaya Koi’s collapse appears to have led to a shift toward a more protected and split legal setup.</li>

  <li>👩‍⚖️ <strong>Proxy Signers & Domestic Shields</strong> — Wives, partners or neighbors quietly used as legal fronts or fallback signatories.</li>
  <li>🔗 <strong>Bank Leverage & Proxy Governance</strong> — Case: Izakaya AB & HSSC Event (2004–2025). Legal structuring, loan tactics & proxy board maneuvers shaping ownership shifts.</li>

  <li>💸 <strong>Share Buyout Scenarios & Reallocation Risks</strong> — Potential ownership transitions and negotiation pathways post-Henrik exit, including Saahil's leverage evolution.</li>

  <li>🍔 <strong>Spin-Off Ventures</strong> — Case study: Sliders & Shakes AB (2017–2025)</li>

  <li>🗞️ <strong>Staffing Visibility Gaps</strong> — Example: Buri Handelsbolag (2022–2025), not listed in reports despite regular staff presence</li>

  <li>➕ <strong>Supplementary Internal Patterns</strong> — Additional historical signals and legal configurations are documented separately for archival coherence.</li>

  <li>🗂️ <strong>Audit & Legal Records</strong> — Public filings and audit trails (2004–2008)</li>

  <li>📁 <strong>Document Annexes – Licenses & Structural Transfers</strong> — Archived permits, architectural drawings, and ownership history supporting timeline coherence. <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0">120+ pages</mark> retrieved, total acquisition cost: <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0">4,320 SEK</mark></li>
