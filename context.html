          This part introduces the <em>narrative grid</em> — a
          <strong>pragmatic label</strong> for a three-part structure designed
          to trace key stages of a workplace conflict through structured
          narrative blocks.
        </p>
        <details open>
          <summary class="section-order">
            🧩 <strong>Part 1 — Narrative Structure of Fact</strong>
          </summary>

          <p>
            <strong>Function:</strong> This section explains
            <strong>how</strong>, <strong>when</strong>, and
            <strong>under what intent</strong> I entered the situation — by
            laying out the
            <strong>conditions, sequence, and strategic meaning</strong> that
            preceded the conflict.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Fields:</strong> This kind of structure appears as a
            <strong>case chronology</strong> (legal), a
            <strong>mission log</strong> (ops), or an
            <strong>incident report</strong> (HR). Comparable formats exist in
            <em>investigative journalism</em> and
            <em>strategic consulting</em> (as practiced by firms like McKinsey,
            EY, or KPMG).
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Usage:</strong> Lawyers, auditors, and compliance agents use
            such forms to detect
            <a href="/glossary.html#managerial-drift">managerial drift</a>,
            <a href="/glossary.html#accountability-gap">accountability gaps</a>,
            or signs of
            <a href="/glossary.html#proxy-communication">proxy communication</a>
            in hierarchical systems.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Adaptation:</strong> This structure serves as a form of
            early positioning. It anticipates legal tactics aiming to minimize
            damage by framing the claimant as incoherent, fragile, or unserious.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Structure:</strong> The narrative follows a strict
            3-paragraph model: intent, chronology, and strategic framing. It
            presents no claim and no emotion — only a foundation.

        <p><u>Strategic Relocation & System Entry</u></p>

        <p>
          I moved to <strong>Ireland</strong> in 2019 — the
          <a

            class="subtle-link"
            >Silicon Valley of EU tech support</a
          >. It was a natural relaunch zone after Asia, with hundreds of roles
          in top-tier call centers. I got
          <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0"
            >multiple interviews at
            <a href="#" class="note-link">FAANG</a></mark
          >
          — but failed to convert.
        </p>

        <p>
          Too senior, too independent, I didn’t fit the mold. Instead, I focused
          on fundamentals: <strong>web development</strong>,
          <strong>low-level C</strong>, and basic algorithms. By 2021, as
          <u>Covid restrictions were lifted</u>, I was ready to move.
        </p>
        <p>
          In <strong>2021</strong>, after 3 years in <strong>Ireland</strong>, I
          booked a one-way flight to

          to escape, but was
          <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0">denied entry</mark> after one
          week in custody — likely due to
          <span class="note-link">Covid status</span> and
          <span class="note-link">lack of clear purpose</span>. Authorities paid
          my return to

        <p>
          From Nice, I was contacted by an old friend based in
          <span class="internal-link">Paris</span>, proposing a vague idea of
          launching a business " to make money together" —. Once on site, I
          discovered the true intent: using my name to rescue a

          clarity, and no long-term direction. I left Paris drained, and headed
          to <strong>Gothenburg</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          — a quieter choice, since I'd already lived in Stockholm. Normally, I
          never repeat countries, but
          <span class="note-link">Sweden was familiar</span>, relaxed on Covid
          (no mandates, no vax), and I had context: I’d worked here in
          <a href="governance.html#gotmyteam" class="internal-link">2018</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          The goal: <strong>launch a startup</strong> or find paid work to
          bootstrap one. My long-term plan — still active — was
          <strong>Asia</strong>. Not Hong Kong again, but
          <span class="note-link">Singapore</span>: a clean reset.
        </p>

        <p>
          I moved to <span class="internal-link">Gothenburg</span> seeking
          greater stability. I briefly worked as an independent courier for
          <a href="https://www.foodora.se" class="subtle-link">Foodora</a>,
          which allowed me to obtain a <strong>samordningsnummer</strong>, then
          a <strong>personnummer</strong> through formal work.
        </p>

        <p>
          I first settled in <strong>Gothenburg</strong>, where I stayed several
          months and briefly worked as an independent courier for
          <a href="https://www.foodora.se" class="subtle-link">Foodora</a>. This
          role enabled me to obtain a
          <strong>samordningsnummer</strong> (temporary number), and shortly
          after, a <strong>personnummer</strong> through formal employment.

          Before leaving Gothenburg, I had already rented a
          <strong>coworking space</strong> where I began outlining long-term
          projects. This was my first professional space in Sweden—an anchor
          that typically signals the start of any personal rebuild.

          <p><u>Early Cohabitation & Mutual Dependence</u></p>
          <p>
            I met Sarah online shortly before relocating to Stockholm. Within
            two weeks, we moved in together—partly due to a strong connection,
            but mostly driven by mutual economic need. She had two children and
            had just lost her flatmate. I needed stable housing in Stockholm. It
            felt mutually logical.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="context-block">
          <p><u>Shared Budget & Informal Agreement</u></p>
          <p>
            From my first full paycheck, I contributed up to
            <strong>16,000 SEK/month</strong> toward rent, food, car fuel,
            insurance, and more. This amount also included an informal
            reimbursement for the initial months she had supported me.
          </p>
          <p>
            We had a verbal agreement: either we would build a family, or we
            would build a company. This was my condition for long-term
            involvement. I called it our <em>pilot agreement</em>.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="context-block">
          <p><u>Communication Challenges & “Pilotalks”</u></p>
          <p>
            From the outset, I insisted on structured communication. I created
            the concept of <em>Pilotalks</em>: one hour of discussion every
            evening, and weekend walks to reflect and recalibrate. These efforts
            were short-lived. Over time, communication degraded. My repeated
            attempts to create a weekly agenda or set shared goals were avoided.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="context-block">
          <p><u>Business Initiative & Weekend Withdrawal</u></p>
          <p>
            We rented a shared office to develop a review-based platform. I
            covered around <strong>75% of the costs</strong>, and she was to
            contribute time. Although enthusiastic at first, she soon
            disengaged—particularly on weekends, which she reserved for leisure.
          </p>
          <p>
            I tried to bridge our differences by aligning on values, building a
            company culture, researching competitors, and setting a shared
            vision. I proposed working sessions to define purpose, mission, and
            market niche. Despite pockets of motivation, the consistent effort
            never followed.

          <p><u>Imbalance & Emotional Weight</u></p>
          <p>
            I began to notice deeper misalignments: parenting philosophies far
            from my own, unresolved emotional burdens from her past, and
            recurring disrespect—from both her and her children. Her
            ex-partner’s presence added stress, often interrupting our daily
            rhythm or affecting her mood.
          </p>
          <p>
            I felt reduced to a provider. The trust I offered was used for
            comfort, not growth. Meanwhile, I was contributing over
            <strong>three-quarters of my income</strong>, emotionally and
            financially committed to something that wasn’t moving forward.

        <section class="context-block">
          <p><u>Departure & Closure</u></p>
          <p>
            I lived with her for 14 months. When neither a family nor a business
            seemed possible, I made the decision to leave. My departure was
            clean, without conflict. I never demanded anything in return.
          </p>
          <p>
            I retain full documentation of my financial contributions. I believe
            we helped each other for a time, but when the terms silently
            collapsed, I chose to walk away and realign with my path.
          </p>
        </section>
        <p><u>Using Restaurants as a Launch Pad</u></p>
        <p>
          The move was deliberate. My goal was to stabilize my legal and
          financial status while gradually preparing for
          <strong>independent tech work</strong>. I chose restaurants as a
          <strong>strategic entry point</strong>: quick cashflow, proof of
          address, and immediate access to the
          <u>Swedish system</u> (personnummer, unemployment insurance, banking).
        </p>
        <p><u>Last Job Before Quan</u></p>
        <p>
          Before joining Quan, I worked for 14 months as a dishwasher at
          <strong>Da Peppe Due</strong>, a well-known pizzeria in Stockholm. The
          environment was relaxed yet functional. When tasks were done, it was
          acceptable to rest, scroll through Instagram, or sit in the private
          dining room until the next rush. What mattered was being ready when
          needed, and responsive under pressure.
        </p>

        <p>
          My chef’s philosophy was simple: the restaurant should work smoothly
          <u>without his constant presence</u>. That meant trusting the staff,
          avoiding drama, and preventing complaints. We were never monitored for
          how we spent our downtime. We ate what we wanted. I regularly
          photographed my meals, which ranged from lasagna to steak, and even
          considered creating an Instagram account just for them. Salaries were
          fair—and sometimes higher than expected.
        </p>

        <section class="narrative-comparison">
          <p>
            I left for strategic reasons, but I never felt disposable. That job
            left me with a sense of
            <strong>trust, dignity, and horizontal respect</strong>. It shaped
            my expectations—and helped me detect when the opposite was
            happening.
          </p>

          <p>
            Despite this, the city's
            <strong>stress, noise, and compressed energy</strong> had become too
            much. I needed calmer surroundings, both socially and mentally.
            <strong>Malmö offered a logical reset</strong>: softer social
            dynamics, fewer frictions, and a milder climate—one I knew would be
            safer to endure if housing became uncertain again.
          </p>
        </section>

        <p><u>End of Phase One</u></p>

        <p>
          I had regained everything I needed materially after nearly a decade of
          precariousness. I had secured eligibility for unemployment benefits.
          But remaining a <strong>dishwasher</strong> any longer would have
          meant accepting a symbolic label I could no longer carry. The second
          phase of my strategy had to begin.
        </p>

        <p><u>Phase Two – From Precarity to Readiness</u></p>
        <p>
          In May 2024, after a breakup, I entered a period of
          <strong

              >housing precarity</a
            ></strong
          >
          in Stockholm. I no longer had stable shelter, but I retained 24/7
          access to a <strong>coworking space</strong>. The following month, in
          June, I worked in two restaurants and earned
          <strong>32,000 SEK</strong>—my highest official monthly income.
        </p>

        <p>
          This marked the start of <strong>Phase Two</strong>: securing the
          final tools for <strong>tech entrepreneurship</strong>. I aimed to
          acquire a car, an ultra-wide monitor, a backup laptop, and
          <strong
            ><a
              href="https://verksamt.se/en/setting-up/choose-business-type/limited-company"
              >25,000 SEK in incorporation funds</a
            ></strong
          >. Once covered, <strong>Phase Three</strong>—building the
          company—could begin.
        </p>

        <p><u>Arrival in Malmö</u></p>
        <p>
          I arrived in Malmö on <strong>November 1, 2024</strong>, determined to
          resume work in a higher-standard kitchen. I shortlisted venues with
          <strong>top-rated service reviews</strong>, hoping to find a place
          where my obsessive attention to detail would be seen as an asset—not a
          flaw, as in my last job.

          mvp. But on April 13, I decided to put this work on hold in order to
          fully dedicate myself to the research, writing, and development of
          <strong>Aftershift.se</strong>.

          <h2>⏳ Personal Cost & Strategic Time Lost</h2>

          <p>
            <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0">Since 2011</mark>, I had
            been seeking a rare combination:
            <u>stable shelter, secured income, and uninterrupted time</u> to
            build a company. For over a decade, I never reached that
            equilibrium—until now.
          </p>

          <p>
            In <strong>March 2024</strong>, I finally entered this phase: I had
            access to a coworking space, received unemployment benefits, and
            cleared the bandwidth to launch my own startup. For the first time
            in <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0">15 years</mark>, I was
            not consumed by survival. I had one year, a desk, and the breathing
            room to <u>work toward independence</u>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Yet within weeks of returning to Malmö, I discovered a situation
            that violated
            <u>both labor laws and personal dignity</u>. I had to make a choice:
            pursue my startup, or investigate what I was witnessing. I chose the
            second.
            <strong
              >This research cost me 3 months—and counting— of the only
              protected time I’ve had since 2011</strong
            >.
          </p>

          <p>
            This sacrifice isn’t symbolic. It means I delayed the
            <mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0"
              >only professional window I’ve ever secured</mark
            >—in terms of time, finances, and tools.
            <u>I was not paid, nor prepared, to do this work</u>. But ethically,
            it felt impossible to look away.
