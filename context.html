        <p>
          This section provides a <strong>narrative structure of facts</strong>, sometimes referred to as a
          <em>case chronology</em> (legal), a <em>mission log</em> (military/ops), or an <em>incident report</em> (HR).

        <p>
          It is not evidence, but a <strong>structured recounting</strong> of key stages, written from the perspective of the affected party.
          Such frameworks are often used by lawyers, auditors, or inspectors to detect <strong>patterns of discrepancy, accountability gaps, or managerial drift</strong>.

        I arrived in Sweden in April 2022, first in Gothenburg, then in
        Stockholm. I worked for 14 months at
        <strong><a href="https://dapeppedue.se/">Da Peppe Due</a></strong
        >, a pizzeria where I earned up to
        <strong

        >
        per month, enjoyed free meals, and operated in a flexible environment.
      </p>

      <p>
        Before moving to Sweden, I mostly worked in <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrice-kenmo%C3%A9-a27236207"><strong>technical support</strong></a> and <strong>IT operations</strong>
         roles across Europe — sometimes with
         <strong>partial engineering</strong> or <strong>coordination responsibilities</strong>. 
          This was the first time I had
        held a truly subordinate position for so long. And after a full year,
        despite the salary and decent conditions, the role had become
        <strong>morally exhausting</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        I had regained everything I needed materially after nearly a decade of
        precariousness. I had secured eligibility for unemployment benefits. But
        remaining a <strong>dishwasher</strong> any longer would have meant
        accepting a symbolic label I could no longer carry. The second phase of
        my strategy had to begin.
      </p>

      <p>
        In May 2024, after a breakup, I entered a period of
        <strong
          ><a
            href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rtj9b9BVrquGxQHegjPrs6o0ZP-9BRoR/view?usp=sharing"
            >housing precarity</a
          ></strong
        >
        in Stockholm. I no longer had stable shelter, but I retained 24/7 access
        to a <strong>coworking space</strong>. The following month, in June, I
        worked in two restaurants and earned <strong>32,000 SEK</strong>—my
        highest official monthly income.
      </p>

      <p>
        Despite this, the city's
        <strong>stress, noise, and compressed energy</strong> had become too
        much. I needed calmer surroundings, both socially and mentally.
        <strong>Malmö offered a logical reset</strong>: softer social dynamics,
        fewer frictions, and a milder climate—one I knew would be safer to
        endure if housing became uncertain again.
      </p>

      <p>
        This marked the start of <strong>Phase Two</strong>: securing the final
        tools for <strong>tech entrepreneurship</strong>. I aimed to acquire a
        car, an ultra-wide monitor, a backup laptop, and
        <strong
          ><a
            href="https://verksamt.se/en/setting-up/choose-business-type/limited-company"
            >25,000 SEK in incorporation funds</a
          ></strong
        >. Once covered, <strong>Phase Three</strong>—building the company—could
        begin.
      </p>
      <p>
        I arrived in Malmö on <strong>November 1, 2024</strong>, determined to resume work in a higher-standard kitchen. I shortlisted venues with <strong>top-rated service reviews</strong>, hoping to find a place where my obsessive attention to detail would be seen as an asset—not a flaw, as in my last job.
      </p>
      <p>
        On <strong>November 16</strong>, I sent a spontaneous application to <strong>Quan</strong>. I was aware the restaurant was attached to a hotel, but only during my trial shift did I fully realize the extent of its integration within a <strong>4-star hotel</strong>.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Many of my early questions—about dishware, trolleys, or food storage—were answered with “it’s for the hotel.” I deduced that the entire food and conference service, including breakfast, was run by the same company, but no clear onboarding ever explained these overlaps. The structure remained opaque.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>On November 25</strong> between <strong><a
            href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1s6uTnBQcGgQGCoqQVsxj-ili6KFA7bZ1/view?usp=sharing">around 2 PM</a></strong></strong>, I was invited to what became a hiring interview in a small back room. A woman greeted me warmly, but without introduction. I assumed she was a <strong>senior waitress</strong> temporarily assisting the process.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Her familiarity felt disproportionate coming from someone I’d never met. I responded politely but awkwardly, unsure who she was. When she and Henrik entered the meeting room together, she naturally led the conversation. That’s when I assumed she was <strong>in charge of the restaurant</strong>—someone with practical authority beyond her official title.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        No one introduced her or confirmed her title. Later, colleagues casually referred to her as <em>“the boss.”</em> I had no reason to doubt it. I only discovered much later she was <strong>formally listed as Deputy Board Member</strong>—a position that carries no formal management authority in Sweden.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        That gap between perceived authority and official status didn’t strike me immediately, but it shaped a subtle confusion. I adapted to her leadership as if she were the founder or legal manager. At no point was I told otherwise.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>
        That ambiguity had immediate consequences: moments earlier, I had greeted several team members, including a <strong>floor manager</strong> I’d bonded with during my shift. He ignored my handshake. In retrospect, I interpreted this as a reaction to my rushed greeting to her—possibly seen as a <strong>lack of deference to the executive lead</strong>.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        The session itself was warm. <strong>Henrik showed visible enthusiasm</strong>, while Sahar remained measured but positive. Both seemed relieved to have found someone <em>“reliable”</em>. I, too, felt I had landed in the right place, though I sensed a slight mismatch between Sahar’s informal posture and the authority she embodied.
      </p>
      <p>
        The tone was enthusiastic. They expressed visible relief at finding someone “reliable.” They emphasized three principles: <strong>punctuality</strong>, <strong>exclusive availability</strong>, and <strong>attention to detail</strong>—framed as missing virtues in their previous hires.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        I was offered an hourly rate of <strong>160 SEK/h</strong> on the spot, based on my CV and the trial performance. I disclosed an existing weekend job, which Sahar acknowledged without hesitation, even framing it as a sign of integrity.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        During that meeting, <strong>Sahar mentioned a digital contract</strong> would be sent. I expected it within days, but no document ever arrived. No login credentials, no confirmation, no follow-up. The promise remained unfulfilled despite clear mutual agreement.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        I also raised a condition: receiving a share of <strong>tips</strong>. They said the matter would be discussed with the floor and bar managers. A few days later, both confirmed their approval individually. No contract followed, but Sahar briefly mentioned one would—possibly via their internal system. That mention was never repeated.
      </p>
      <p>
        Throughout this period, <strong>my only point of contact was Henrik</strong>. His number was the only one I received. Any attempt to address questions or follow up—about schedules, duties, or documents—was redirected: <em>“I'll ask Sahar.”</em> Eventually, <strong>I stopped asking</strong>. He often seemed embarrassed or reluctant.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        When he was absent, I was told to ask the <strong>sous-chefs</strong>. That proved even more difficult. Their responses felt dismissive, and I quickly sensed that <strong>pushing further was unwelcome</strong>. I began submitting written questions to the restaurant’s general email. These were not challenged, but I knew <strong>they fell outside accepted channels</strong>.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        The meeting lasted approximately <strong>30 minutes</strong>, between <strong>13:53 and 14:28</strong>, as confirmed in my Google Timeline. Though informal in tone, it set the <strong>essential terms of work</strong> and gave rise to what I interpreted as the <strong>start of formal employment</strong>.
