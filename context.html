          This part introduces the <em>narrative grid</em> â€” a
          <strong>pragmatic label</strong> for a three-part structure designed
          to trace key stages of a workplace conflict through structured
          narrative blocks.
        </p>
        <details open>
          <summary class="section-order">
            ðŸ§© <strong>Part 1 â€” Narrative Structure of Fact</strong>
          </summary>

          <p>
            <strong>Function:</strong> This section explains
            <strong>how</strong>, <strong>when</strong>, and
            <strong>under what intent</strong> I entered the situation â€” by
            laying out the
            <strong>conditions, sequence, and strategic meaning</strong> that
            preceded the conflict.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Fields:</strong> This kind of structure appears as a
            <strong>case chronology</strong> (legal), a
            <strong>mission log</strong> (ops), or an
            <strong>incident report</strong> (HR). Comparable formats exist in
            <em>investigative journalism</em> and
            <em>strategic consulting</em> (as practiced by firms like McKinsey,
            EY, or KPMG).
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Usage:</strong> Lawyers, auditors, and compliance agents use
            such forms to detect
            <a href="/glossary.html#managerial-drift">managerial drift</a>,
            <a href="/glossary.html#accountability-gap">accountability gaps</a>,
            or signs of
            <a href="/glossary.html#proxy-communication">proxy communication</a>
            in hierarchical systems.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Adaptation:</strong> This structure serves as a form of
            early positioning. It anticipates legal tactics aiming to minimize
            damage by framing the claimant as incoherent, fragile, or unserious.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Structure:</strong> The narrative follows a strict
            3-paragraph model: intent, chronology, and strategic framing. It
            presents no claim and no emotion â€” only a foundation.
          </p>

        <p><u>Strategic Return to Sweden</u></p>
        <p>
          After three years in Ireland and a strategic return through Nice and
          Barcelona, I arrived in
          <a

            >Sweden</a
          >
          in April 2022. I first lived in <strong>Gothenburg</strong>, where I
          spent one yearâ€”including three months as a <u>fodora delivery</u>.
          Then, I relocated to <strong>Stockholm</strong> to pursue
          higher-paying roles in hospitality.

        <p><u>Using Restaurants as a Launch Pad</u></p>
        <p>
          The move was deliberate. My goal was to stabilize my legal and
          financial status while gradually preparing for
          <strong>independent tech work</strong>. I chose restaurants as a
          <strong>strategic entry point</strong>: quick cashflow, proof of
          address, and immediate access to the
          <u>Swedish system</u> (personnummer, unemployment insurance, banking).
        </p>
        <p><u>Last Job Before Quan</u></p>
        <p>
          Before joining Quan, I worked for 14 months as a dishwasher at
          <strong>Da Peppe Due</strong>, a well-known pizzeria in Stockholm. The
          environment was relaxed yet functional. When tasks were done, it was
          acceptable to rest, scroll through Instagram, or sit in the private
          dining room until the next rush. What mattered was being ready when
          needed, and responsive under pressure.
        </p>

        <p>
          My chefâ€™s philosophy was simple: the restaurant should work smoothly
          <u>without his constant presence</u>. That meant trusting the staff,
          avoiding drama, and preventing complaints. We were never monitored for
          how we spent our downtime. We ate what we wanted. I regularly
          photographed my meals, which ranged from lasagna to steak, and even
          considered creating an Instagram account just for them. Salaries were
          fairâ€”and sometimes higher than expected.
        </p>

        <section class="narrative-comparison">
          <p>
            I left for strategic reasons, but I never felt disposable. That job
            left me with a sense of
            <strong>trust, dignity, and horizontal respect</strong>. It shaped
            my expectationsâ€”and helped me detect when the opposite was
            happening.
          </p>

          <p>
            Despite this, the city's
            <strong>stress, noise, and compressed energy</strong> had become too
            much. I needed calmer surroundings, both socially and mentally.
            <strong>MalmÃ¶ offered a logical reset</strong>: softer social
            dynamics, fewer frictions, and a milder climateâ€”one I knew would be
            safer to endure if housing became uncertain again.
          </p>
        </section>

        <p><u>End of Phase One</u></p>

        <p>
          I had regained everything I needed materially after nearly a decade of
          precariousness. I had secured eligibility for unemployment benefits.
          But remaining a <strong>dishwasher</strong> any longer would have
          meant accepting a symbolic label I could no longer carry. The second
          phase of my strategy had to begin.
        </p>

        <p><u>Phase Two â€“ From Precarity to Readiness</u></p>
        <p>
          In May 2024, after a breakup, I entered a period of
          <strong

              href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rtj9b9BVrquGxQHegjPrs6o0ZP-9BRoR/view?usp=sharing"
              >housing precarity</a
            ></strong
          >
          in Stockholm. I no longer had stable shelter, but I retained 24/7
          access to a <strong>coworking space</strong>. The following month, in
          June, I worked in two restaurants and earned
          <strong>32,000 SEK</strong>â€”my highest official monthly income.
        </p>

        <p>
          This marked the start of <strong>Phase Two</strong>: securing the
          final tools for <strong>tech entrepreneurship</strong>. I aimed to
          acquire a car, an ultra-wide monitor, a backup laptop, and
          <strong
            ><a
              href="https://verksamt.se/en/setting-up/choose-business-type/limited-company"
              >25,000 SEK in incorporation funds</a
            ></strong
          >. Once covered, <strong>Phase Three</strong>â€”building the
          companyâ€”could begin.
        </p>

        <p><u>Arrival in MalmÃ¶</u></p>
        <p>
          I arrived in MalmÃ¶ on <strong>November 1, 2024</strong>, determined to
          resume work in a higher-standard kitchen. I shortlisted venues with
          <strong>top-rated service reviews</strong>, hoping to find a place
          where my obsessive attention to detail would be seen as an assetâ€”not a
          flaw, as in my last job.
