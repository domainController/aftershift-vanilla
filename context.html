      <section class="narrative-intro">
        <p>
          This part introduces the <em>narrative grid</em> ‚Äî a
          <strong>pragmatic label</strong> for a three-part structure designed
          to trace key stages of a workplace conflict through structured
          narrative blocks.
        </p>
        <details open>
          <summary class="section-order">
            üß© <strong>Part 1 ‚Äî Narrative Structure of Fact</strong>
          </summary>

          <p>
            <strong>Function:</strong> This section explains
            <strong>how</strong>, <strong>when</strong>, and
            <strong>under what intent</strong> I entered the situation ‚Äî by
            laying out the
            <strong>conditions, sequence, and strategic meaning</strong> that
            preceded the conflict.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Fields:</strong> This kind of structure appears as a
            <strong>case chronology</strong> (legal), a
            <strong>mission log</strong> (ops), or an
            <strong>incident report</strong> (HR). Comparable formats exist in
            <em>investigative journalism</em> and
            <em>strategic consulting</em> (as practiced by firms like McKinsey,
            EY, or KPMG).
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Usage:</strong> Lawyers, auditors, and compliance agents use
            such forms to detect
            <a href="/glossary.html#managerial-drift">managerial drift</a>,
            <a href="/glossary.html#accountability-gap">accountability gaps</a>,
            or signs of
            <a href="/glossary.html#proxy-communication">proxy communication</a>
            in hierarchical systems.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Adaptation:</strong> This structure serves as a form of
            early positioning. It anticipates legal tactics aiming to minimize
            damage by framing the claimant as incoherent, fragile, or unserious.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Structure:</strong> The narrative follows a strict
            3-paragraph model: intent, chronology, and strategic framing. It
            presents no claim and no emotion ‚Äî only a foundation.
          </p>

        I arrived in Sweden in April 2022, first in Gothenburg, then in
        Stockholm. I worked for 14 months at
        <strong><a href="https://dapeppedue.se/">Da Peppe Due</a></strong
        >, a pizzeria where I earned up to
        <strong
          ><a
            href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dgAYR3CPEaqNFUOpsShy7LYe7sNq49jW/view?usp=sharing"
            >28,000 SEK net</a
          ></strong
        >
        per month, enjoyed free meals, and operated in a flexible environment.
      </p>

      <p>
        Before moving to Sweden, I mostly worked in
        <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrice-kenmo%C3%A9-a27236207"
          ><strong>technical support</strong></a
        >
        and <strong>IT operations</strong>
        roles across Europe ‚Äî sometimes with
        <strong>partial engineering</strong> or
        <strong>coordination responsibilities</strong>. This was the first time
        I had held a truly subordinate position for so long. And after a full
        year, despite the salary and decent conditions, the role had become
        <strong>morally exhausting</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        I had regained everything I needed materially after nearly a decade of
        precariousness. I had secured eligibility for unemployment benefits. But
        remaining a <strong>dishwasher</strong> any longer would have meant
        accepting a symbolic label I could no longer carry. The second phase of
        my strategy had to begin.
      </p>

      <p>
        In May 2024, after a breakup, I entered a period of
        <strong
          ><a
            href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rtj9b9BVrquGxQHegjPrs6o0ZP-9BRoR/view?usp=sharing"
            >housing precarity</a
          ></strong
        >
        in Stockholm. I no longer had stable shelter, but I retained 24/7 access
        to a <strong>coworking space</strong>. The following month, in June, I
        worked in two restaurants and earned <strong>32,000 SEK</strong>‚Äîmy
        highest official monthly income.
      </p>

      <p>
        Despite this, the city's
        <strong>stress, noise, and compressed energy</strong> had become too
        much. I needed calmer surroundings, both socially and mentally.
        <strong>Malm√∂ offered a logical reset</strong>: softer social dynamics,
        fewer frictions, and a milder climate‚Äîone I knew would be safer to
        endure if housing became uncertain again.
      </p>

      <p>
        This marked the start of <strong>Phase Two</strong>: securing the final
        tools for <strong>tech entrepreneurship</strong>. I aimed to acquire a
        car, an ultra-wide monitor, a backup laptop, and
        <strong
          ><a
            href="https://verksamt.se/en/setting-up/choose-business-type/limited-company"
            >25,000 SEK in incorporation funds</a
          ></strong
        >. Once covered, <strong>Phase Three</strong>‚Äîbuilding the company‚Äîcould
        begin.
      </p>
      <p>
        I arrived in Malm√∂ on <strong>November 1, 2024</strong>, determined to
        resume work in a higher-standard kitchen. I shortlisted venues with
        <strong>top-rated service reviews</strong>, hoping to find a place where
        my obsessive attention to detail would be seen as an asset‚Äînot a flaw,
        as in my last job.
      </p>
      <p>
        On <strong>November 16</strong>, I sent a spontaneous application to
        <strong>Quan</strong>. I was aware the restaurant was attached to a
        hotel, but only during my trial shift did I fully realize the extent of
        its integration within a <strong>4-star hotel</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Many of my early questions‚Äîabout dishware, trolleys, or food
        storage‚Äîwere answered with ‚Äúit‚Äôs for the hotel.‚Äù I deduced that the
        entire food and conference service, including breakfast, was run by the
        same company, but no clear onboarding ever explained these overlaps. The
        structure remained opaque.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>
          <a
            href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1s6uTnBQCgQGC0qQVsxj-ili6KFA7bZ1/view?usp=sharing"
            >around 2 PM</a
          >
        </strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        Her familiarity felt disproportionate coming from someone I‚Äôd never met.
        I responded politely but awkwardly, unsure who she was. When she and
        Henrik entered the meeting room together, she naturally led the
        conversation. That‚Äôs when I assumed she was
        <strong>in charge of the restaurant</strong>‚Äîsomeone with practical
        authority beyond her official title.
      </p>

      <p>
        No one introduced her or confirmed her title. Later, colleagues casually
        referred to her as <em>‚Äúthe boss.‚Äù</em> I had no reason to doubt it. I
        only discovered much later she was
        <strong>formally listed as Deputy Board Member</strong>‚Äîa position that
        carries no formal management authority in Sweden.
      </p>

      <p>
        That gap between perceived authority and official status didn‚Äôt strike
        me immediately, but it shaped a subtle confusion. I adapted to her
        leadership as if she were the founder or legal manager. At no point was
        I told otherwise.
      </p>

      <p>
        That ambiguity had immediate consequences: moments earlier, I had
        greeted several team members, including a
        <strong>floor manager</strong> I‚Äôd bonded with during my shift. He
        ignored my handshake. In retrospect, I interpreted this as a reaction to
        my rushed greeting to her‚Äîpossibly seen as a
        <strong>lack of deference to the executive lead</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The session itself was warm.
        <strong>Henrik showed visible enthusiasm</strong>, while Sahar remained
        measured but positive. Both seemed relieved to have found someone
        <em>‚Äúreliable‚Äù</em>. I, too, felt I had landed in the right place,
        though I sensed a slight mismatch between Sahar‚Äôs informal posture and
        the authority she embodied.
      </p>
      <p>
        The tone was enthusiastic. They expressed visible relief at finding
        someone ‚Äúreliable.‚Äù They emphasized three principles:
        <strong>punctuality</strong>, <strong>exclusive availability</strong>,
        and <strong>attention to detail</strong>‚Äîframed as missing virtues in
        their previous hires.
      </p>

      <p>
        I was offered an hourly rate of <strong>160 SEK/h</strong> on the spot,
        based on my CV and the trial performance. I disclosed an existing
        weekend job, which Sahar acknowledged without hesitation, even framing
        it as a sign of integrity.
      </p>

      <p>
        During that meeting,
        <strong>Sahar mentioned a digital contract</strong> would be sent. I
        expected it within days, but no document ever arrived. No login
        credentials, no confirmation, no follow-up. The promise remained
        unfulfilled despite clear mutual agreement.
      </p>

      <p>
        I also raised a condition: receiving a share of <strong>tips</strong>.
        They said the matter would be discussed with the floor and bar managers.
        A few days later, both confirmed their approval individually. No
        contract followed, but Sahar briefly mentioned one would‚Äîpossibly via
        their internal system. That mention was never repeated.
      </p>
      <p>
        Throughout this period,
        <strong>my only point of contact was Henrik</strong>. His number was the
        only one I received. Any attempt to address questions or follow up‚Äîabout
        schedules, duties, or documents‚Äîwas redirected:
        <em>‚ÄúI'll ask Sahar.‚Äù</em> Eventually,
        <strong>I stopped asking</strong>. He often seemed embarrassed or
        reluctant.
      </p>

      <p>
        When he was absent, I was told to ask the <strong>sous-chefs</strong>.
        That proved even more difficult. Their responses felt dismissive, and I
        quickly sensed that <strong>pushing further was unwelcome</strong>. I
        began submitting written questions to the restaurant‚Äôs general email.
        These were not challenged, but I knew
        <strong>they fell outside accepted channels</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The meeting lasted approximately <strong>30 minutes</strong>, between
        <strong>13:53 and 14:28</strong>, as confirmed in my Google Timeline.
        Though informal in tone, it set the
        <strong>essential terms of work</strong> and gave rise to what I
        interpreted as the <strong>start of formal employment</strong>.
