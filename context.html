          This part introduces the <em>narrative grid</em> ‚Äî a
          <strong>pragmatic label</strong> for a three-part structure designed
          to trace key stages of a workplace conflict through structured
          narrative blocks.
        </p>
        <details open>
          <summary class="section-order">
            üß© <strong>Part 1 ‚Äî Narrative Structure of Fact</strong>
          </summary>

          <p>
            <strong>Function:</strong> This section explains
            <strong>how</strong>, <strong>when</strong>, and
            <strong>under what intent</strong> I entered the situation ‚Äî by
            laying out the
            <strong>conditions, sequence, and strategic meaning</strong> that
            preceded the conflict.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Fields:</strong> This kind of structure appears as a
            <strong>case chronology</strong> (legal), a
            <strong>mission log</strong> (ops), or an
            <strong>incident report</strong> (HR). Comparable formats exist in
            <em>investigative journalism</em> and
            <em>strategic consulting</em> (as practiced by firms like McKinsey,
            EY, or KPMG).
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Usage:</strong> Lawyers, auditors, and compliance agents use
            such forms to detect
            <a href="/glossary.html#managerial-drift">managerial drift</a>,
            <a href="/glossary.html#accountability-gap">accountability gaps</a>,
            or signs of
            <a href="/glossary.html#proxy-communication">proxy communication</a>
            in hierarchical systems.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Adaptation:</strong> This structure serves as a form of
            early positioning. It anticipates legal tactics aiming to minimize
            damage by framing the claimant as incoherent, fragile, or unserious.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Structure:</strong> The narrative follows a strict
            3-paragraph model: intent, chronology, and strategic framing. It
            presents no claim and no emotion ‚Äî only a foundation.
          </p>

        <p><u>Strategic Relocation & System Entry</u></p>
        <p>
          After three years in Ireland, I began a strategic return through Nice
          and
          <a href="governance.html#governance-fragment" class="subtle-link"
            >Paris</a
          >, where I attempted to join a failing business led by a former
          friend. The plan‚Äîframed as a company revival‚Äîquickly revealed deeper
          structural issues (see
          <a href="governance.html#governance-fragment" class="subtle-link"
            >Governance Section</a
          >). After seven months, I left and chose to relocate to

          in April 2022, aiming for a more stable and transparent environment.
        </p>

        <p>
          I first settled in <strong>Gothenburg</strong>, where I stayed several
          months and briefly worked as an independent courier for
          <a href="https://www.foodora.se" class="subtle-link">Foodora</a>. This
          role enabled me to obtain a
          <strong>samordningsnummer</strong> (temporary number), and shortly
          after, a <strong>personnummer</strong> through formal employment.

        <p>
          Before leaving Gothenburg, I had already rented a
          <strong>coworking space</strong> where I began outlining long-term
          projects. This was my first professional space in Sweden‚Äîan anchor
          that typically signals the start of any personal rebuild.

          <p><u>Early Cohabitation & Mutual Dependence</u></p>
          <p>
            I met Sarah online shortly before relocating to Stockholm. Within
            two weeks, we moved in together‚Äîpartly due to a strong connection,
            but mostly driven by mutual economic need. She had two children and
            had just lost her flatmate. I needed stable housing in Stockholm. It
            felt mutually logical.
          </p>

        <section class="context-block">
          <p><u>Shared Budget & Informal Agreement</u></p>
          <p>
            From my first full paycheck, I contributed up to
            <strong>16,000 SEK/month</strong> toward rent, food, car fuel,
            insurance, and more. This amount also included an informal
            reimbursement for the initial months she had supported me.
          </p>
          <p>
            We had a verbal agreement: either we would build a family, or we
            would build a company. This was my condition for long-term
            involvement. I called it our <em>pilot agreement</em>.

        <section class="context-block">
          <p><u>Communication Challenges & ‚ÄúPilotalks‚Äù</u></p>
          <p>
            From the outset, I insisted on structured communication. I created
            the concept of <em>Pilotalks</em>: one hour of discussion every
            evening, and weekend walks to reflect and recalibrate. These efforts
            were short-lived. Over time, communication degraded. My repeated
            attempts to create a weekly agenda or set shared goals were avoided.

        <section class="context-block">
          <p><u>Business Initiative & Weekend Withdrawal</u></p>
          <p>
            We rented a shared office to develop a review-based platform. I
            covered around <strong>75% of the costs</strong>, and she was to
            contribute time. Although enthusiastic at first, she soon
            disengaged‚Äîparticularly on weekends, which she reserved for leisure.
          </p>
          <p>
            I tried to bridge our differences by aligning on values, building a
            company culture, researching competitors, and setting a shared
            vision. I proposed working sessions to define purpose, mission, and
            market niche. Despite pockets of motivation, the consistent effort
            never followed.

        <section class="context-block">
          <p><u>Imbalance & Emotional Weight</u></p>
          <p>
            I began to notice deeper misalignments: parenting philosophies far
            from my own, unresolved emotional burdens from her past, and
            recurring disrespect‚Äîfrom both her and her children. Her
            ex-partner‚Äôs presence added stress, often interrupting our daily
            rhythm or affecting her mood.
          </p>
          <p>
            I felt reduced to a provider. The trust I offered was used for
            comfort, not growth. Meanwhile, I was contributing over
            <strong>three-quarters of my income</strong>, emotionally and
            financially committed to something that wasn‚Äôt moving forward.

        <section class="context-block">
          <p><u>Departure & Closure</u></p>
          <p>
            I lived with her for 14 months. When neither a family nor a business
            seemed possible, I made the decision to leave. My departure was
            clean, without conflict. I never demanded anything in return.
          </p>
          <p>
            I retain full documentation of my financial contributions. I believe
            we helped each other for a time, but when the terms silently
            collapsed, I chose to walk away and realign with my path.

        <p><u>Using Restaurants as a Launch Pad</u></p>
        <p>
          The move was deliberate. My goal was to stabilize my legal and
          financial status while gradually preparing for
          <strong>independent tech work</strong>. I chose restaurants as a
          <strong>strategic entry point</strong>: quick cashflow, proof of
          address, and immediate access to the
          <u>Swedish system</u> (personnummer, unemployment insurance, banking).
        </p>
        <p><u>Last Job Before Quan</u></p>
        <p>
          Before joining Quan, I worked for 14 months as a dishwasher at
          <strong>Da Peppe Due</strong>, a well-known pizzeria in Stockholm. The
          environment was relaxed yet functional. When tasks were done, it was
          acceptable to rest, scroll through Instagram, or sit in the private
          dining room until the next rush. What mattered was being ready when
          needed, and responsive under pressure.
        </p>

        <p>
          My chef‚Äôs philosophy was simple: the restaurant should work smoothly
          <u>without his constant presence</u>. That meant trusting the staff,
          avoiding drama, and preventing complaints. We were never monitored for
          how we spent our downtime. We ate what we wanted. I regularly
          photographed my meals, which ranged from lasagna to steak, and even
          considered creating an Instagram account just for them. Salaries were
          fair‚Äîand sometimes higher than expected.
        </p>

        <section class="narrative-comparison">
          <p>
            I left for strategic reasons, but I never felt disposable. That job
            left me with a sense of
            <strong>trust, dignity, and horizontal respect</strong>. It shaped
            my expectations‚Äîand helped me detect when the opposite was
            happening.
          </p>

          <p>
            Despite this, the city's
            <strong>stress, noise, and compressed energy</strong> had become too
            much. I needed calmer surroundings, both socially and mentally.
            <strong>Malm√∂ offered a logical reset</strong>: softer social
            dynamics, fewer frictions, and a milder climate‚Äîone I knew would be
            safer to endure if housing became uncertain again.
          </p>
        </section>

        <p><u>End of Phase One</u></p>

        <p>
          I had regained everything I needed materially after nearly a decade of
          precariousness. I had secured eligibility for unemployment benefits.
          But remaining a <strong>dishwasher</strong> any longer would have
          meant accepting a symbolic label I could no longer carry. The second
          phase of my strategy had to begin.
        </p>

        <p><u>Phase Two ‚Äì From Precarity to Readiness</u></p>
        <p>
          In May 2024, after a breakup, I entered a period of
          <strong
            ><a
              href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rtj9b9BVrquGxQHegjPrs6o0ZP-9BRoR/view?usp=sharing"
              >housing precarity</a
            ></strong
          >
          in Stockholm. I no longer had stable shelter, but I retained 24/7
          access to a <strong>coworking space</strong>. The following month, in
          June, I worked in two restaurants and earned
          <strong>32,000 SEK</strong>‚Äîmy highest official monthly income.
        </p>

        <p>
          This marked the start of <strong>Phase Two</strong>: securing the
          final tools for <strong>tech entrepreneurship</strong>. I aimed to
          acquire a car, an ultra-wide monitor, a backup laptop, and
          <strong
            ><a
              href="https://verksamt.se/en/setting-up/choose-business-type/limited-company"
              >25,000 SEK in incorporation funds</a
            ></strong
          >. Once covered, <strong>Phase Three</strong>‚Äîbuilding the
          company‚Äîcould begin.
        </p>

        <p><u>Arrival in Malm√∂</u></p>
        <p>
          I arrived in Malm√∂ on <strong>November 1, 2024</strong>, determined to
          resume work in a higher-standard kitchen. I shortlisted venues with
          <strong>top-rated service reviews</strong>, hoping to find a place
          where my obsessive attention to detail would be seen as an asset‚Äînot a
          flaw, as in my last job.
        </p>

        <p>
          Since March 21, I had
          <a

          fully dedicate myself to the research, writing, and development of
