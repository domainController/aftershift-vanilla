          <strong>Liability Mapping (Hybrid Restaurant Governance)</strong>
        </summary>
        <p>
          <strong>Function:</strong> This mapping helps clarify
          <strong
            >who acts, who decides, and who holds legal responsibility</strong
          >
          within Quan’s operational structure. It highlights overlaps between
          <strong>ownership, delegation, and public-facing control</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Fields:</strong> Inspired by tools like a
          <strong>liability map</strong> (legal strategy),
          <strong>delegated ownership charts</strong> (corporate audits), and
          <strong>hybrid governance diagrams</strong> (used in
          <em>hospitality outsourcing</em>, <em>franchise consulting</em>, or
          <em>operational compliance</em>).
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Usage:</strong> Used by <strong>legal analysts</strong>,
          <strong>compliance teams</strong> (e.g. internal audit, regulatory
          staff), and <strong>governance advisors</strong> (e.g. strategic
          consultants for partnerships) to examine
          <strong>responsibility chains</strong>,
          <strong>control logic</strong>, and
          <strong>ownership/operation boundaries</strong> in co-managed
          ventures.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Adaptation:</strong> This model is applied to
          <strong>clarify how responsibility was distributed</strong> without
          formal titles or clear legal attribution. It provides a lens to
          observe
          <strong>how tasks and decisions shifted between actors</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Structure:</strong> The section highlights
          <strong>visible and latent hierarchies</strong> between hotel staff,
          branded leadership, and off-site owners. It distinguishes
          <strong>contractual obligations</strong> from
          <strong>day-to-day control</strong> — to map where legal and
          operational authority may diverge.
        </p>
      </details>

      <p>
        By <strong>2014</strong>, Henrik is understood to have joined
        <strong>Renaissance Hotel Malmö</strong> (then under
        <strong>Marriott</strong> branding). He gradually took over
        <strong>food and beverage operations</strong>, reportedly holding that
        role for two and a half years by <strong>2018</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        In <strong>February 2018</strong>, the Renaissance Hotel was acquired by
        a Swedish group and renamed <strong>Elite Hotel Adlon</strong>. Shortly
        after, the restaurant project <strong>Quan</strong> was launched on the
        same premises. Henrik Siebert was introduced as
        <strong>concept lead</strong> and <strong>co-manager</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Quan operates physically within the premises of Elite Hotel Esplanade,
        at Mäster Johansgatan 15 in Malmö. While customers often believe they
        are dealing directly with hotel staff,
        <strong
          >the restaurant is managed independently, under separate legal
          entities</strong
        >.
      </p>

      <p>
        The integration is <strong>logistical rather than visual</strong>: Quan
        shares the physical space of the hotel, but
        <strong
          >employment and managerial responsibilities are externalized to
          private companies</strong
        >
        with no direct affiliation to the Elite Hotels group.
      </p>

      <p>
        When I first considered applying at Quan, I conducted a standard
        ownership check to tailor my motivation email.
        <strong
          >Henrik Kei Siebert was the only visible public figure linked to the
          restaurant</strong
        >, repeatedly cited in hotel communications and online articles as its
        founder.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong
          >No trace of a distinct legal entity operating Quan appeared in public
          records</strong
        >, which left me uncertain about whom to address—and forced me to send a
        generic, unpersonalized message.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was only after a few days on site that I discovered the restaurant
        was legally operated by <strong>HSSC Event AB</strong>—not Quan, nor
        Elite Hotel. The name appeared in the internal scheduling platform
        <strong>Personalkollen</strong>, which employees used to access shift
        information.
      </p>

      <p>
        My job interview had been conducted by a woman who introduced herself as
        <strong>Sahar</strong>—"like Sahara", she said. Only later, by
        cross-checking the name in Personalkollen, did I understand she held a
        formal role within <strong>HSSC Event AB</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        A quick search in the Swedish business register confirmed that
        <strong>HSSC Event AB</strong> was the legal entity linked to the
        restaurant. It listed <strong>Sahar El Nasser</strong> as
        <em>suppleant</em> (alternate board member), with no other listed
        responsibilities at that time.
      </p>

      <p>
        Despite this, <strong>Henrik Kei Siebert</strong>—the only visible
        public figure associated with Quan—did not appear anywhere in official
        records. His absence from the company’s registration was surprising,
        given his public role and occasional presence on site.
      </p>
      <p>
        On public business directories such as <strong>Allabolag</strong>, the
        structure of <em>HSSC Event AB</em> appears minimal. The company is
        registered at the same address as Quan Restaurant, yet no explicit
        reference to the restaurant is made.
      </p>

      <p>
        Only two names are listed:
        <strong>Alexander Saahil Chudasama</strong> (ledamot) and
        <strong>Sahar El Nasser</strong> (suppleant). No shareholder information
        or operational description is available beyond this bare minimum.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>According to the Swedish Beneficial Ownership Register</strong>,
        HSSC Event AB is controlled by KEHDA Holding AB, through which Lin
        Daniella Dahl holds between 50–75% of the shares. Her name is absent
        from operational documents and restaurant-facing materials.
      </p>

      <p>
        Meanwhile, <strong>Chudasama Invest AB</strong>, held by Alexander
        Chudasama, owns under 25% of shares. However, the 2021 Articles of
        Association grant him rights to appoint and dismiss the majority of the
        board, giving him de facto operational control.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Lin Daniella Dahl</strong> and
        <strong>Henrik Kei Siebert</strong> are both registered at the same
        residential address in Trelleborg. Their shared domicile suggests a
        likely domestic relationship, although not formally stated in company
        documents.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Sahar El Nasser</strong> and
        <strong>Alexander Saahil Chudasama</strong> also appear as cohabitants
        in Malmö, based on population registry data. This co-residency
        reinforces the possibility of internal alignment in the governance of
        HSSC Event AB.

          ⚖️ Legal Note: Beneficial Ownership and Coordination of
          Responsibilities
        </summary>
        <br />
        <p>
          Under EU Directive 2015/849 on anti-money laundering, Swedish
          companies must register their <em>verklig huvudman</em> (beneficial
          owner) separately from board representatives. This aims to prevent
          opaque control structures.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the case of HSSC Event AB, public board data lists Mr. Chudasama
          and Ms. El Nasser, while the Beneficial Ownership Register identifies
          Ms. Dahl as majority owner via KEHDA Holding AB—absent from
          operational materials.
        </p>
        <p>
          This divergence reflects a deliberate
          <strong>liability compartmentalization</strong> strategy:
          responsibilities are split across entities and persons, shielding
          accountability behind formal roles.
        </p>
        <p>
          Personal records reveal cross-linked domestic ties: Ms. Dahl cohabits
          with Mr. Siebert, and Ms. El Nasser with Mr. Chudasama. While not
          illegal, such dual alignments reinforce internal control patterns not
          visible in legal filings.
        </p>
        <p>
          The company name <strong>HSSC</strong> appears to derive from the
          initials of <strong>H</strong>enrik Kei <strong>S</strong>iebert
          (<strong>HS</strong>) and Alexander<strong> S</strong>aahil
          <strong>C</strong>hudasama (<strong>SC</strong>). This naming pattern
          reinforces their underlying influence, despite limited mention in
          legal or operational records.

          ⚖️ Legal Note: Legal Disclosure Obligations for Commercial Websites
        </summary>
        <br />

        Most jurisdictions—including Sweden—require commercial websites to
        identify their legal operator. In Sweden, this is enforced by the
        <a href="https://lagen.nu/2002:562#P8S1" target="_blank"
          >E-commerce Act (2002:562)</a
        >, which mandates clear display of the company name, organisation
        number, VAT ID, and contact details.

        <br /><br />

        This transparency protects consumers and employees, facilitates
        accountability, and ensures traceability of online businesses. Similar
        obligations exist across the EU, Germany (<em>Impressumspflicht</em>),
        and France (mentions légales), among others.

        <br /><br />

        Omission of such disclosures is not always illegal, but it typically
        indicates either informal structuring or intent to limit visibility,
        which can obstruct due diligence or legal recourse in case of dispute.
      </details>

      <p>
        Throughout my three weeks of employment at Quan,
        <strong>Saahil Chudasama</strong>—officially listed as a co-owner—was
        <strong>never seen on-site</strong>. No colleague ever mentioned him,
        and his name played no role in daily operations.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Henrik Kei Sieber</strong>, publicly introduced as the lead
        figure behind Quan, maintained a
        <strong>discreet yet regular presence</strong>. I observed him working
        no more than two to three days a week, typically welcoming guests and
        overseeing the front-of-house with focused attention.
      </p>

      <p>
        Though visibly committed during those shifts, his involvement remained
        minimal outside of them. He stayed socially distant, rarely interacting
        with staff or showing signs of operational leadership.
      </p>
      <p>
        What stood out to me was the
        <strong
          >complete absence of communication between Henrik and Sahar</strong
        >. During my three weeks at Quan, I never saw them speak or exchange
        even a glance. For someone trying to understand their role, this silence
        was striking.
      </p>

      <p>
        Henrik’s role appeared
        <strong>detached from the daily team flow</strong>. I never witnessed
        him share a joke, give a directive, or interact casually with staff.
        From my position in the back kitchen, he always seemed removed, even
        when physically present.
      </p>

      <p>
        By contrast,
        <strong>Sahar was visibly active in team coordination</strong>. I saw
        her engage directly with the floor manager, the head chef, and multiple
        sous-chefs—often inside the kitchen. She also managed interviews and
        subcontractor issues. There was no doubt she operated at the core of
        daily operations.

          📌 Structural Note: Informal Leadership, Formal Incorporation
        </summary>
        <br />

        No internal communication or shared leadership structure was visible
        during the <strong>observed period</strong>. Staff routines followed
        <strong>practical rather than hierarchical logic</strong>, with no
        direct managerial access linked to the
        <strong>two registered owners</strong>.<br /><br />

        This model coexisted with
        <strong>remarkable financial output</strong>—reportedly over 5 million
        SEK in net profit in 2023, and
        <strong>3 weeks of advance booking</strong> at all times. The later
        registration of <em>Tributum AB</em> may indicate a step toward
        structural consolidation or <em>structural clarity</em>.
      </details>

      <p>
        <strong>On July 1st, 2024</strong>, two new legal entities were
        incorporated on the same day: <strong>Tributum AB</strong> and
        <strong>Aspiratio Holding AB</strong>. Both companies list board members
        directly connected to Quan and share the exact same address:
        <em>Mäster Johansgatan 15, Malmö</em> — the known location of Quan, HSSC
        Event AB, and Elite Hotel.
      </p>

      <p>
        Tributum AB officially declared a business activity of
        <strong>restaurant operations (restaurangverksamhet)</strong>. Its board
        includes <strong>Henrik Kei Siebert</strong> as CEO,
        <strong>Sahar El Nasser</strong> as board member, and
        <strong>Lin Daniella Dahl</strong> as deputy. This configuration mirrors
        operational roles already observed at Quan.
      </p>

      <p>
        By contrast, <strong>Aspiratio Holding AB</strong> is formally
        registered under <em>c/o Kehda Holding AB</em>, but still at the same
        Malmö address. Despite being legally active, Aspiratio shows
        <strong>no declared business activity</strong>,
        <strong>no F-tax registration</strong>, <strong>no VAT (Moms)</strong>,
        and <strong>no employer contributions</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Its board lists <strong>Lin Daniella Dahl</strong> as chair and
        <strong>Sahar El Nasser</strong> as deputy — forming the same tandem
        involved in Tributum, with overlapping but formally distinct roles. Both
        entities were created simultaneously and appear dormant or inactive on
        paper.
      </p>

      <p>
        This synchronised registration raises strategic questions. While
        <em>Tributum AB</em> was presented as a formal clarification of
        restaurant activity, <em>Aspiratio</em> could serve as a
        <em>holding or fallback structure</em>, or as a shielded platform
        disconnected from declared payroll operations.

          <strong>Aspiratio Holding AB</strong>, both created on July 1st at the
          same address, goes beyond <strong>administrative convenience</strong>.
          Their design suggests an attempt to
          <strong>redistribute roles</strong>,
          <strong>separate exposures</strong>, and
          <strong>clarify legal responsibility</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          While Tributum declared active restaurant operations,
          <strong>Aspiratio remains structurally dormant</strong>: no payroll,
          no declared business. This silent setup may offer
          <strong>future flexibility</strong>,
          <strong>discreet compensation flows</strong>, or
          <strong>risk management</strong> beyond the main operation.
        </p>
        <p>
          This dual setup could act as a <strong>buffer</strong>—absorbing
          pressure, shielding liability, or preparing for change—without public
          disclosure or fiscal trace.
        </p>
      </details>

      <p>
        Two chefs, <strong>Robin Albay Dinopol</strong> and
        <strong>Satoru Yoshizawa</strong>, who were regularly scheduled on
        evening shifts, were later identified as the sole partners of
        <strong>BURI Handelsbolag</strong> (org.nr 969798-6447). Their company
        is not listed as a subcontractor, but they both worked onsite as cooks.
      </p>

      <p>
        This configuration raises the possibility of
        <strong>undeclared subcontracting</strong>, where staff are employed
        through a third-party vehicle without formal declaration. No document or
        contract was disclosed to clarify the terms of their engagement with
        Quan or HSSC Event AB.
      </p>

      <p>
        No public record directly links <strong>Elite Hotels</strong> and
        <strong>HSSC Event AB</strong>. However, both companies officially
        operate from the same address:
        <strong>Mäster Johansgatan 15, Malmö</strong>. This overlap may indicate
        a tenancy or subcontracting arrangement, but the absence of published
        contracts prevents confirmation.
      </p>

      <p>
        Another <strong>external subcontractor</strong> was regularly observed
        on site every Friday night. A cleaning couple arrived at approximately
        <strong>23:30</strong> and remained on site until around
        <strong>04:00</strong>, working four hours each.
      </p>

      <p>
        Their presence accounted for a total of
        <strong>eight hours per session</strong>. They were not listed on any
        official schedule, and no company name or contractual arrangement was
        ever disclosed. Management suggested I might be asked to
        <strong>replace them</strong> due to dissatisfaction with their work.
      </p>

      <p>
        Separately, the <strong>employment certificate</strong> issued in my
        name was <strong>signed by Sahar El Nasser</strong>. This formal act
        establishes her involvement in administrative and personnel matters,
        beyond her nominal board position.
      </p>

      <p>
        Despite being officially registered only as a
        <em>suppleant</em> (alternate board member), her signature confirms an
        <strong>operational role in human resources</strong>. It also implies
        her position as the primary interface with
        <strong>external entities such as HRAK</strong>.
