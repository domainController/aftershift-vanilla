            The method was first developed in the 2010s by financial
            investigators working on corruption and shell companies. It‚Äôs now
            used by investigative journalists, fraud examiners, and forensic
            analysts to spot real control hidden behind fake legal structures.
          </p>
        </details>
        <p>
          <strong>Fields:</strong> Inspired by tools like a
          <strong>liability map</strong> (legal strategy),
          <strong>delegated ownership charts</strong> (corporate audits), and
          <strong>hybrid governance diagrams</strong> (used in
          <em>hospitality outsourcing</em>, <em>franchise consulting</em>, or
          <em>operational compliance</em>).
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Usage:</strong> Used by <strong>legal analysts</strong>,
          <strong>compliance teams</strong> (e.g. internal audit, regulatory
          staff), and <strong>governance advisors</strong> (e.g. strategic
          consultants for partnerships) to examine
          <strong>responsibility chains</strong>,
          <strong>control logic</strong>, and
          <strong>ownership/operation boundaries</strong> in co-managed
          ventures.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Adaptation:</strong> This model is applied to
          <strong>clarify how responsibility was distributed</strong> without
          formal titles or clear legal attribution. It provides a lens to
          observe
          <strong>how tasks and decisions shifted between actors</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Structure:</strong> The section highlights
          <strong>visible and latent hierarchies</strong> between hotel staff,
          branded leadership, and off-site owners. It distinguishes
          <strong>contractual obligations</strong> from
          <strong>day-to-day control</strong> ‚Äî to map where legal and
          operational authority may diverge.

      <span class="highlight">(reg. no. 556881-0641)</span> ‚Äî renaming it
      <strong>Chudasama Invest AB</strong>. The shift adopts the

        <strong>HSSC Event AB</strong> (registration no.

        <strong>On April 29</strong>, a second vehicle ‚Äî a Porsche Taycan 4S ‚Äî
        was added under the same leasing scheme as the first. This confirms a
        pattern of <strong>company-based access to premium vehicles</strong>,
        though ownership intent remains unverified.

        Quan operates physically within the premises of Elite Hotel Esplanade,
        at M√§ster Johansgatan 15 in Malm√∂. While customers often believe they
        are dealing directly with hotel staff,
        <strong
          >the restaurant is managed independently, under separate legal
          entities</strong
        >.
      </p>

      <p>
        A quick search in the Swedish business register confirmed that
        <strong>HSSC Event AB</strong> was the legal entity linked to the
        restaurant. It listed <strong>Sahar El Nasser</strong> as
        <em>suppleant</em> (alternate board member), with no other listed
        responsibilities at that time.
      </p>

      <p>
        On public business directories such as <strong>Allabolag</strong>, the
        structure of <em>HSSC Event AB</em> appears minimal. The company is
        registered at the same address as Quan Restaurant, yet no explicit
        reference to the restaurant is made.
      </p>

      <p>
        Only two names are listed:
        <strong>Alexander Saahil Chudasama</strong> (ledamot) and
        <strong>Sahar El Nasser</strong> (suppleant). No shareholder information
        or operational description is available beyond this bare minimum.
      </p>

      <p>
        Meanwhile, <strong>Chudasama Invest AB</strong>, held by Alexander
        Chudasama, owns under 25% of shares. However, the 2021 Articles of
        Association grant him rights to appoint and dismiss the majority of the
        board, giving him de facto operational control.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Lin Daniella Dahl</strong> and
        <strong>Henrik Kei Siebert</strong> are both registered at the same
        residential address in Trelleborg. Their shared domicile suggests a
        likely domestic relationship, although not formally stated in company
        documents.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Sahar El Nasser</strong> and
        <strong>Alexander Saahil Chudasama</strong> also appear as cohabitants
        in Malm√∂, based on population registry data. This co-residency
        reinforces the possibility of internal alignment in the governance of
        HSSC Event AB.
      </p>

      <p>
        Though visibly committed during those shifts, his involvement remained
        minimal outside of them. He stayed socially distant, rarely interacting
        with staff or showing signs of operational leadership.
      </p>
      <p>
        What stood out to me was the
        <strong
          >complete absence of communication between Henrik and Sahar</strong
        >. During my three weeks at Quan, I never saw them speak or exchange
        even a glance. For someone trying to understand their role, this silence
        was striking.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>On July 1st, 2024</strong>, two new legal entities were
        incorporated on the same day: <strong>Tributum AB</strong> and
        <strong>Aspiratio Holding AB</strong>. Both companies list board members
        directly connected to Quan and share the exact same address:
        <em>M√§ster Johansgatan 15, Malm√∂</em> ‚Äî the known location of Quan, HSSC
        Event AB, and Elite Hotel.
      </p>

      <p>
        By contrast, <strong>Aspiratio Holding AB</strong> is formally
        registered under <em>c/o Kehda Holding AB</em>, but still at the same
        Malm√∂ address. Despite being legally active, Aspiratio shows
        <strong>no declared business activity</strong>,
        <strong>no F-tax registration</strong>, <strong>no VAT (Moms)</strong>,
        and <strong>no employer contributions</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Its board lists <strong>Lin Daniella Dahl</strong> as chair and
        <strong>Sahar El Nasser</strong> as deputy ‚Äî forming the same tandem
        involved in Tributum, with overlapping but formally distinct roles. Both
        entities were created simultaneously and appear dormant or inactive on
        paper.
      </p>

      <p>
        No public record directly links <strong>Elite Hotels</strong> and
        <strong>HSSC Event AB</strong>. However, both companies officially
        operate from the same address:
        <strong>M√§ster Johansgatan 15, Malm√∂</strong>. This overlap may indicate
        a tenancy or subcontracting arrangement, but the absence of published
        contracts prevents confirmation.
