      <h3>📌 <span style="font-size: 1.2rem; font-weight: 600">2015</span></h3>
      <p>
        By <strong>2015</strong>, Henrik is understood to have joined
        <strong>Renaissance Hotel Malmö</strong> (then under
        <strong>Marriott</strong> branding). He gradually took over
        <strong>food and beverage operations</strong>, reportedly holding that
        role for two and a half years by <strong>2018</strong>.
      </p>

      <h3>📌 <span style="font-size: 1.2rem; font-weight: 600">2016</span></h3>

      📎 <strong>December 12</strong>, <strong>Saahil</strong> (36) restructures
      his personal company — formerly known as <u>Saahil AB</u>
      <span class="highlight">(reg. no. 556881-0641)</span> — renaming it
      <strong>Chudasama Invest AB</strong>. The shift adopts the
      <a href="notes.html#note-invest-ab" class="subtle-link">Invest AB</a>
      format, signaling a transition from personal branding to structured asset
      holding.

      <h3>📌 <span style="font-size: 1.2rem; font-weight: 600">2018</span></h3>
      <p>
        <strong>On February 1, 2018</strong>, following negotiations with
        <span class="highlight">Balder (556525-6905)</span>, the
        <strong>Elite Hotels of Sweden</strong> group (5562485259) secured the
        <u>operating rights</u> to the <strong>Renaissance Malmö Hotel</strong>,
        replacing <span class="highlight">Marriott</span> as operator.
      </p>

      <p>
        The dedicated subsidiary <strong>Elite Rosen Malmö AB</strong> assumed
        control and temporarily <u>rebranded the venue</u> as
        <strong>Elite Hotel Adlon</strong>, a transitional identity during the
        franchise handover phase.
      </p>

      <p>
        📄 <strong>On June 25</strong>, a company
        <strong>HSSC Event AB</strong> (registration no.
        <strong>559163-2764</strong>) is officially registered in Malmö. Its
        name clearly reflects the initials of <u>Henrik Siebert</u> and
        <u>Saahil Chudasama</u>, who were both
        <strong>publicly presented as “co-founders” of the Quan project</strong
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        📄 The company,
        <strong
          >registered under the activity of restaurant and event
          services</strong
        >, lists <strong>Mäster Johansgatan 15, Malmö</strong> as its official
        address — the same as the hotel hosting the Quan project.
      </p>

      <p></p>
      <p>
        📌 All other companies introduced in this sequence are likewise
        <strong>legally domiciled at the same address</strong>, forming what is
        often referred to as a
        <a href="notes.html#note-shared-setup">shared registration setup</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        📑 In the legal filings, <strong>Saahil Chudasama</strong> is declared
        as <a href="notes.html#board-member">board member</a>, and
        <strong>Sahar El Nasser</strong> as
        <a href="notes.html#deputy-board-member">deputy board member</a>.

        >
        — holding <u>between 50% and 75%</u> of the company — is controlled by
        <strong>Daniella Lin Dahl</strong>. <u>Saahil Chudasama</u>, via
        <em>Chudasama Invest AB</em>, holds <u>less than 25%</u> but retains
        <strong>strategic rights</strong>, including board control.
      </p>

      <p style="line-height: 1.5">
        ⚠️ <strong>Henrik Siebert</strong> does
        <u>not appear in any official role</u> at the time of HSSC Event AB’s
        registration (559163-2764), despite being publicly recognized as the
        face behind the Quan project. This visible absence may reflect a
        <a href="notes.html#note-proxy-governance" class="subtle-link">
          <span class="highlight">protective distancing strategy</span></a
        >, delegating legal appearances to proxies while retaining actual
        control in the background.
      </p>
      <h3>📌 <span style="font-size: 1.2rem; font-weight: 600">2019</span></h3>
      <p>
        On <strong>1 February</strong>, the hotel officially adopts the name
        <strong>Elite Hotel Esplanade</strong>, resolving a brand conflict after
        a year of ambiguity. The legal structure remains unchanged under
        <u>Elite Rosen Malmö AB</u>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ownership is now fully concentrated in the hands of Caroline,
        <strong>only daughter of the late Bicky Chakraborty</strong>, who passed
        away in <u>2022</u>. A legendary hotelier and longtime member of
        <span class="highlight">Sweden’s top 10 fortunes</span>, Bicky built a
        family legacy that now blends private empire with
        <strong>royal lineage</strong>.
      </p>

      <h3>📌 <span style="font-size: 1.2rem; font-weight: 600">2020</span></h3>

      <p>
        📄 <strong>On 30 September</strong>, company no.
        <strong>559274-2042</strong> is registered under the name KEHDA Holding
        AB. Its declared purpose is <u>property and asset management</u>,…with
        initial control held by
        <strong>Bolagsstiftarna appointees (as in 2012)</strong> — all replaced
        weeks later by Daniella Lin Dahl.
      </p>

      <p>
        📌 Despite reporting
        <u>no employees, clients, or listed assignments</u>, KEHDA votes four
        consecutive <strong>profit distributions</strong> between 2021 and 2024,
        totaling <strong>over 1.2 million SEK</strong>. At least one appears
        linked to
        <span style="background-color: #e5e7eb"
          >strategic advisory billing from HSSC Event AB</span
        >, without itemized explanation.
      </p>

      <p>
        🧩 The setup suggests a <u>silent profit vehicle</u>: KEHDA operates
        without public presence, while its sole representative shares a
        residence with <strong>Henrik Siebert</strong>. This may indicate a
        <span style="background-color: #e5e7eb">private holding layer</span>,
        designed to channel earnings while shielding visible ownership.
      </p>
      <h3>📌 <span style="font-size: 1.2rem; font-weight: 600">2022</span></h3>
      <p>
        <strong>As of 31 December</strong>, for the fiscal year 2022,
        <strong>Daniella Dahl</strong> declared a monthly net salary of

        <strong>16,879 SEK</strong> in dividends issued via

        At year-end, <strong>Elite Rosen Malmö AB</strong> (25 employees)
        recorded a revenue of <strong>41,759,000 SEK</strong> and a monthly net
        profit of <strong>≈ 106,083 SEK</strong>, with a
        <strong>net profit margin of 3.05%</strong>. Each employee generated ≈
        <strong>1,670,360 SEK/year</strong> in gross revenue.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the same period, <strong>HSSC Event AB</strong> (Quan, 21 employees)
        posted a revenue of <strong>41,107,903 SEK</strong> and a monthly net
        profit of <strong>≈ 440,843 SEK</strong>, yielding a
        <strong>net margin of 12.87%</strong>. Revenue per employee reached ≈
        <strong>1,957,519 SEK/year</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Quan generated <strong>4.15× more net profit per month</strong> than the
        host hotel, with fewer staff and almost identical turnover — underlining
        a sharply different financial extraction model.
      </p>
      <h3>📌 <span style="font-size: 1.2rem; font-weight: 600">2024</span></h3>

      <p>
        <strong>On February 20</strong>, Restaurang Steakhouse Lilla Torg AB
        registered a <strong>Tesla Model Y</strong> under leasing. The vehicle
        is not registered in the name of any board member, but its use remains
        undocumented.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>On March 4</strong>, a second <strong>Tesla Model Y</strong> was
        leased by the same company, which employs around 20 staff. The vehicle
        is likely used by individuals close to daily operations.
      </p>
      <p>
        📄 <strong>On 1 July</strong>, two new companies are formally
        registered: <strong>Tributum AB</strong> (Org.nr: 559488-5484) and
        <strong>Aspiratio Holding AB</strong> (Org.nr: 559488-5476). Two new
        entities, pulled once again from the ever-stocked shelves of
        <u>Bolagsstiftarna AB</u>, specialists in shelf-company logistics.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>On December 8</strong>, a first high-end vehicle — a BMW 330E
        Xdrive — was registered under HSSC Event's name via leasing.
        <span class="highlight"
          >No personal car appears linked to the two women listed in official
          structures</span

      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>On December 15</strong>,
        <span class="highlight">Daniela</span> is listed as beneficial owner of
        <strong>C8 Communicate AB</strong> (ownership <strong>≤ 25%</strong>),
        alongside <span class="highlight">Patrik Lindfors</span> (ownership
        <strong>50–75%</strong>). This initiative reportedly aligns with another
        project Henrik was focused on at the time.
      </p>

      <h3>📌 <span style="font-size: 1.2rem; font-weight: 600">2025</span></h3>

      <p>
        <strong>On April 29</strong>, a second vehicle — a Porsche Taycan 4S —
        was added under the same leasing scheme as the first. This confirms a
        pattern of <strong>company-based access to premium vehicles</strong>,
        though ownership intent remains unverified.
      </p>
      <p>
        Quan operates physically within the premises of Elite Hotel Esplanade,
        at Mäster Johansgatan 15 in Malmö. While customers often believe they
        are dealing directly with hotel staff,
        <strong
          >the restaurant is managed independently, under separate legal
          entities</strong
        >.
      </p>

      <p>
        🧱 <strong>Tributum AB</strong> is declared as a restaurant business,
        while <strong>Aspiratio</strong> is set up as a property and asset
        manager. This distinction suggests an early intent to separate
        <u>operational activities</u> from <u>holding structures</u>.
      </p>

      <p>
        📍 Both are registered at the same address as HSSC and KEHDA, further
        reinforcing the emerging architecture. Whether these entities were
        created to absorb risk, optimize flows, or serve future roles remains to
        be clarified.
      </p>

      <p>
        A quick search in the Swedish business register confirmed that
        <strong>HSSC Event AB</strong> was the legal entity linked to the
        restaurant. It listed <strong>Sahar El Nasser</strong> as
        <em>suppleant</em> (alternate board member), with no other listed
        responsibilities at that time.
      </p>

      <p>
        On public business directories such as <strong>Allabolag</strong>, the
        structure of <em>HSSC Event AB</em> appears minimal. The company is
        registered at the same address as Quan Restaurant, yet no explicit
        reference to the restaurant is made.
      </p>

      <p>
        Only two names are listed:
        <strong>Alexander Saahil Chudasama</strong> (ledamot) and
        <strong>Sahar El Nasser</strong> (suppleant). No shareholder information
        or operational description is available beyond this bare minimum.
      </p>

      <p>
        Meanwhile, <strong>Chudasama Invest AB</strong>, held by Alexander
        Chudasama, owns under 25% of shares. However, the 2021 Articles of
        Association grant him rights to appoint and dismiss the majority of the
        board, giving him de facto operational control.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Lin Daniella Dahl</strong> and
        <strong>Henrik Kei Siebert</strong> are both registered at the same
        residential address in Trelleborg. Their shared domicile suggests a
        likely domestic relationship, although not formally stated in company
        documents.
      </p>

        <strong>Sahar El Nasser</strong> and
        <strong>Alexander Saahil Chudasama</strong> also appear as cohabitants
        in Malmö, based on population registry data. This co-residency
        reinforces the possibility of internal alignment in the governance of
        HSSC Event AB.

        Though visibly committed during those shifts, his involvement remained
        minimal outside of them. He stayed socially distant, rarely interacting
        with staff or showing signs of operational leadership.

        What stood out to me was the
        <strong
          >complete absence of communication between Henrik and Sahar</strong
        >. During my three weeks at Quan, I never saw them speak or exchange
        even a glance. For someone trying to understand their role, this silence
        was striking.

        <strong>On July 1st, 2024</strong>, two new legal entities were
        incorporated on the same day: <strong>Tributum AB</strong> and
        <strong>Aspiratio Holding AB</strong>. Both companies list board members
        directly connected to Quan and share the exact same address:
        <em>Mäster Johansgatan 15, Malmö</em> — the known location of Quan, HSSC
        Event AB, and Elite Hotel.
      </p>

      <p>
        By contrast, <strong>Aspiratio Holding AB</strong> is formally
        registered under <em>c/o Kehda Holding AB</em>, but still at the same
        Malmö address. Despite being legally active, Aspiratio shows
        <strong>no declared business activity</strong>,
        <strong>no F-tax registration</strong>, <strong>no VAT (Moms)</strong>,
        and <strong>no employer contributions</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Its board lists <strong>Lin Daniella Dahl</strong> as chair and
        <strong>Sahar El Nasser</strong> as deputy — forming the same tandem
        involved in Tributum, with overlapping but formally distinct roles. Both
        entities were created simultaneously and appear dormant or inactive on
        paper.
      </p>

      <p>
        No public record directly links <strong>Elite Hotels</strong> and
        <strong>HSSC Event AB</strong>. However, both companies officially
        operate from the same address:
        <strong>Mäster Johansgatan 15, Malmö</strong>. This overlap may indicate
        a tenancy or subcontracting arrangement, but the absence of published
        contracts prevents confirmation.
