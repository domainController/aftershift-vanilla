        Personnel costs absorbed <strong>49%</strong> of gross revenue, while

        <span class="highlight">56,855 SEK/month</span> — representing
        <strong>≈ 90%</strong> of the year’s total profits. This confirms that
        <strong>Chudasama Invest AB</strong> was, at the time,
        <u>the sole extraction vehicle</u>.

      <p>
        📄 <strong>On 30 September</strong>, company no.
        <strong>559274-2042</strong> is registered under the name KEHDA Holding
        AB. Its declared purpose is <u>property and asset management</u>,…with
        initial control held by
        <strong>Bolagsstiftarna appointees (as in 2012)</strong> — all replaced
        weeks later by Daniella Lin Dahl.
      </p>

      <p>
        📌 Despite reporting
        <u>no employees, clients, or listed assignments</u>, KEHDA votes four
        consecutive <strong>profit distributions</strong> between 2021 and 2024,
        totaling <strong>over 1.2 million SEK</strong>. At least one appears
        linked to
        <span style="background-color: #e5e7eb"
          >strategic advisory billing from HSSC Event AB</span
        >, without itemized explanation.
      </p>

      <p>
        🧩 The setup suggests a <u>silent profit vehicle</u>: KEHDA operates
        without public presence, while its sole representative shares a
        residence with <strong>Henrik Siebert</strong>. This may indicate a
        <span style="background-color: #e5e7eb">private holding layer</span>,
        designed to channel earnings while shielding visible ownership.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>As of December 31</strong>, <u>HSSC Event AB</u> employed
        <span class="highlight">10 people</span> and generated
        <span class="highlight">16.3 million SEK</span> in revenue —
        <u>23% down</u> from 2019. Despite this, net profit rose to
        <strong>≈1.18 million SEK</strong> — a <u>+1270% increase</u> — yielding
        a <strong>net margin of 7.25%</strong>.
        <span class="highlight">No dividends were issued</span>, and profits
        were fully retained.
      </p>

      <p>
        This marks a break from the previous
        <a href="notes.html#fluxtendu" class="subtle-link">flux tendu</a> logic,
        suggesting a strategic pause in distribution. The change coincides with
        the creation of KEHDA Holding AB (30 Sept), yet no direct outflows were
        recorded that year.
      </p>

      <p>
        <u>CHUDASAMA Invest AB</u>, still holding 33% of shares, reported
        <strong>0 SEK in revenue</strong> and a net loss of
        <strong>−28,777 SEK</strong>. Its equity remained at
        <span class="highlight">851,443 SEK</span>, with
        <strong>no dividends received</strong>. In practical terms, the vehicle
        held capital but served no active role — confirming a deliberate halt in
        extraction.

        <strong>On February 20</strong>, Restaurang Steakhouse Lilla Torg AB
        registered a <strong>Tesla Model Y</strong> under leasing. The vehicle
        is not registered in the name of any board member, but its use remains
        undocumented.

      <p>
        <strong>On March 4</strong>, a second <strong>Tesla Model Y</strong> was
        leased by the same company, which employs around 20 staff. The vehicle
        is likely used by individuals close to daily operations.

        <strong>On July 1st</strong>,
        <strong>Tributum AB</strong> (<u>559488-5476</u>) was formally
        registered at <strong>Mäster Johansgatan 15, Malmö</strong>. Its stated
        business is <span class="highlight">restaurant operations</span> under
        code 56100. The address matches that of <u>HSSC</u> and <u>KEHDA</u>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The board of <strong>Tributum AB</strong> includes
        <strong>Daniella Dahl</strong> as chair and
        <strong>Sahar El Nasser</strong> as deputy.
        <u>Both hold individual signing authority</u> and are linked to other
        entities in the Quan group.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ownership is split between <strong>KEHDA Holding AB</strong> (<span
          class="highlight"
          >75%</span

        <strong>Aspiratio Holding AB</strong> (<u>559488-5484</u>) was
        registered on the same day and at the same address, but under
        <u>c/o KEHDA Holding AB</u>. It declares
        <span class="highlight">asset and property management</span> as its
        business purpose.
      </p>

      <p>
        As of registration, <strong>Aspiratio</strong> has
        <u>no F-tax status</u>, <u>no VAT registration</u>,
        <u>no employer contributions</u>. The company appears
        <strong>dormant or inactive on paper</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The board structure mirrors Tributum:
        <strong>Sahar El Nasser</strong> is now chair, with
        <strong>Daniella Dahl</strong> as deputy. Their reversed roles suggest a
        <u>shared internal control</u> across distinct entities.
      </p>

      <p>
        Both firms were purchased from <strong>Bolagsstiftarna AB</strong>,
        known for pre-registered shelf companies. Their dual setup indicates a
        <span class="highlight"
          >clear separation between operational control and legal
          ownership</span
        >.
      </p>

        <strong>On December 8</strong>, a first high-end vehicle — a BMW 330E

        alongside <span class="highlight">Patrik Lindfors</span> (ownership

      <p>
        <strong>On April 29</strong>, a second vehicle — a Porsche Taycan 4S —
        was added under the same leasing scheme as the first. This confirms a
        pattern of <strong>company-based access to premium vehicles</strong>,
        though ownership intent remains unverified.

        Quan operates physically within the premises of Elite Hotel Esplanade,
        at Mäster Johansgatan 15 in Malmö. While customers often believe they
        are dealing directly with hotel staff,
        <strong
          >the restaurant is managed independently, under separate legal
          entities</strong
        >.
      </p>

      <p>
        A quick search in the Swedish business register confirmed that
        <strong>HSSC Event AB</strong> was the legal entity linked to the
        restaurant. It listed <strong>Sahar El Nasser</strong> as
        <em>suppleant</em> (alternate board member), with no other listed
        responsibilities at that time.
      </p>

      <p>
        On public business directories such as <strong>Allabolag</strong>, the
        structure of <em>HSSC Event AB</em> appears minimal. The company is
        registered at the same address as Quan Restaurant, yet no explicit
        reference to the restaurant is made.
      </p>

      <p>
        Only two names are listed:
        <strong>Alexander Saahil Chudasama</strong> (ledamot) and
        <strong>Sahar El Nasser</strong> (suppleant). No shareholder information
        or operational description is available beyond this bare minimum.
      </p>

      <p>
        Meanwhile, <strong>Chudasama Invest AB</strong>, held by Alexander
        Chudasama, owns under 25% of shares. However, the 2021 Articles of
        Association grant him rights to appoint and dismiss the majority of the
        board, giving him de facto operational control.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Lin Daniella Dahl</strong> and
        <strong>Henrik Kei Siebert</strong> are both registered at the same
        residential address in Trelleborg. Their shared domicile suggests a
        likely domestic relationship, although not formally stated in company
        documents.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Sahar El Nasser</strong> and
        <strong>Alexander Saahil Chudasama</strong> also appear as cohabitants
        in Malmö, based on population registry data. This co-residency
        reinforces the possibility of internal alignment in the governance of
        HSSC Event AB.
      </p>

      <p>
        Though visibly committed during those shifts, his involvement remained
        minimal outside of them. He stayed socially distant, rarely interacting
        with staff or showing signs of operational leadership.
      </p>
      <p>
        What stood out to me was the
        <strong
          >complete absence of communication between Henrik and Sahar</strong
        >. During my three weeks at Quan, I never saw them speak or exchange
        even a glance. For someone trying to understand their role, this silence
        was striking.
      </p>

      <p>
        No public record directly links <strong>Elite Hotels</strong> and
        <strong>HSSC Event AB</strong>. However, both companies officially
        operate from the same address:
        <strong>Mäster Johansgatan 15, Malmö</strong>. This overlap may indicate
        a tenancy or subcontracting arrangement, but the absence of published
        contracts prevents confirmation.

        Despite this, <strong>quanbyquan.se</strong> has been actively used for
        internal communication. At least four domain-linked emails were
        confirmed as active: hs, se, hk, and <strong>sc@quanbyquan.se</strong>.
