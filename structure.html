          <p style="line-height: 1.4">
            The PPOWER(E) method is a simple tool to figure out who really
            controls a business — not just on paper, but in practice. It’s used
            when official ownership doesn’t match what’s actually happening on
            the ground.

            The name stands for six key things to check. If one person or group

            The method was first developed in the 2010s by financial
            investigators working on corruption and shell companies. It’s now
            used by investigative journalists, fraud examiners, and forensic
            analysts to spot real control hidden behind fake legal structures.
          </p>
        </details>
        <p>
          <strong>Fields:</strong> Inspired by tools like a
          <strong>liability map</strong> (legal strategy),
          <strong>delegated ownership charts</strong> (corporate audits), and
          <strong>hybrid governance diagrams</strong> (used in
          <em>hospitality outsourcing</em>, <em>franchise consulting</em>, or
          <em>operational compliance</em>).
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Usage:</strong> Used by <strong>legal analysts</strong>,
          <strong>compliance teams</strong> (e.g. internal audit, regulatory
          staff), and <strong>governance advisors</strong> (e.g. strategic
          consultants for partnerships) to examine
          <strong>responsibility chains</strong>,
          <strong>control logic</strong>, and
          <strong>ownership/operation boundaries</strong> in co-managed
          ventures.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Adaptation:</strong> This model is applied to
          <strong>clarify how responsibility was distributed</strong> without
          formal titles or clear legal attribution. It provides a lens to
          observe
          <strong>how tasks and decisions shifted between actors</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Structure:</strong> The section highlights
          <strong>visible and latent hierarchies</strong> between hotel staff,
          branded leadership, and off-site owners. It distinguishes
          <strong>contractual obligations</strong> from
          <strong>day-to-day control</strong> — to map where legal and
          operational authority may diverge.

      <h3>📌 <span style="font-size: 1.2rem; font-weight: 600">2015</span></h3>
      <p>
        By <strong>2015</strong>, Henrik is understood to have joined
        <strong>Renaissance Hotel Malmö</strong> (then under
        <strong>Marriott</strong> branding). He gradually took over
        <strong>food and beverage operations</strong>, reportedly holding that
        role for two and a half years by <strong>2018</strong>.
      </p>

      <h3>📌 <span style="font-size: 1.2rem; font-weight: 600">2016</span></h3>

      📎 <strong>December 12</strong>, <strong>Saahil</strong> (36) restructures
      his personal company — formerly known as <u>Saahil AB</u>
      <span class="highlight">(reg. no. 556881-0641)</span> — renaming it
      <strong>Chudasama Invest AB</strong>. The shift adopts the
      <a href="notes.html#note-invest-ab" class="subtle-link">Invest AB</a>
      format, signaling a transition from personal branding to structured asset
      holding.

      <h3>📌 <span style="font-size: 1.2rem; font-weight: 600">2018</span></h3>
      <p>
        <strong>On February 1, 2018</strong>, following negotiations with
        <span class="highlight">Balder (556525-6905)</span>, the
        <strong>Elite Hotels of Sweden</strong> group (5562485259) secured the
        <u>operating rights</u> to the <strong>Renaissance Malmö Hotel</strong>,
        replacing <span class="highlight">Marriott</span> as operator.
      </p>

      <p>
        The dedicated subsidiary <strong>Elite Rosen Malmö AB</strong> assumed
        control and temporarily <u>rebranded the venue</u> as
        <strong>Elite Hotel Adlon</strong>, a transitional identity during the
        franchise handover phase.
      </p>

      <p>
        📄 <strong>On June 25</strong>, a company
        <strong>HSSC Event AB</strong> (registration no.
        <strong>559163-2764</strong>) is officially registered in Malmö. Its
        name clearly reflects the initials of <u>Henrik Siebert</u> and
        <u>Saahil Chudasama</u>, who were both
        <strong>publicly presented as “co-founders” of the Quan project</strong

        📄 The company,

          services</strong
        >, lists <strong>Mäster Johansgatan 15, Malmö</strong> as its official
        address — the same as the hotel hosting the Quan project.
      </p>

      <p></p>
      <p>
        📌 All other companies introduced in this sequence are likewise
        <strong>legally domiciled at the same address</strong>, forming what is
        often referred to as a
        <a href="notes.html#note-shared-setup">shared registration setup</a>.

        registration (559163-2764), despite being publicly recognized as the

      <h3>📌 <span style="font-size: 1.2rem; font-weight: 600">2019</span></h3>
      <p>
        On <strong>1 February</strong>, the hotel officially adopts the name
        <strong>Elite Hotel Esplanade</strong>, resolving a brand conflict after
        a year of ambiguity. The legal structure remains unchanged under
        <u>Elite Rosen Malmö AB</u>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ownership is now fully concentrated in the hands of Caroline,
        <strong>only daughter of the late Bicky Chakraborty</strong>, who passed
        away in <u>2022</u>. A legendary hotelier and longtime member of
        <span class="highlight">Sweden’s top 10 fortunes</span>, Bicky built a
        family legacy that now blends private empire with
        <strong>royal lineage</strong>.

      <h3>📌 <span style="font-size: 1.2rem; font-weight: 600">2020</span></h3>

      <p>
        📄 <strong>On 30 September</strong>, company no.
        <strong>559274-2042</strong> is registered under the name KEHDA Holding
        AB. Its declared purpose is <u>property and asset management</u>,…with
        initial control held by
        <strong>Bolagsstiftarna appointees (as in 2012)</strong> — all replaced
        weeks later by Daniella Lin Dahl.
      </p>

      <p>
        📌 Despite reporting
        <u>no employees, clients, or listed assignments</u>, KEHDA votes four
        consecutive <strong>profit distributions</strong> between 2021 and 2024,
        totaling <strong>over 1.2 million SEK</strong>. At least one appears
        linked to
        <span style="background-color: #e5e7eb"
          >strategic advisory billing from HSSC Event AB</span
        >, without itemized explanation.
      </p>

      <p>
        🧩 The setup suggests a <u>silent profit vehicle</u>: KEHDA operates
        without public presence, while its sole representative shares a
        residence with <strong>Henrik Siebert</strong>. This may indicate a
        <span style="background-color: #e5e7eb">private holding layer</span>,

        <strong>On February 20</strong>, Restaurang Steakhouse Lilla Torg AB
        registered a <strong>Tesla Model Y</strong> under leasing. The vehicle
        is not registered in the name of any board member, but its use remains
        undocumented.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>On March 4</strong>, a second <strong>Tesla Model Y</strong> was
        leased by the same company, which employs around 20 staff. The vehicle
        is likely used by individuals close to daily operations.
      </p>
      <p>
        📄 <strong>On 1 July</strong>, two new companies are formally
        registered: <strong>Tributum AB</strong> (Org.nr: 559488-5484) and
        <strong>Aspiratio Holding AB</strong> (Org.nr: 559488-5476). Two new
        entities, pulled once again from the ever-stocked shelves of
        <u>Bolagsstiftarna AB</u>, specialists in shelf-company logistics.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>On December 8</strong>, a first high-end vehicle — a BMW 330E
        Xdrive — was registered under HSSC Event's name via leasing.

        🧱 <strong>Tributum AB</strong> is declared as a restaurant business,

        A quick search in the Swedish business register confirmed that
        <strong>HSSC Event AB</strong> was the legal entity linked to the
        restaurant. It listed <strong>Sahar El Nasser</strong> as
        <em>suppleant</em> (alternate board member), with no other listed
        responsibilities at that time.
      </p>

      <p>
        On public business directories such as <strong>Allabolag</strong>, the
        structure of <em>HSSC Event AB</em> appears minimal. The company is
        registered at the same address as Quan Restaurant, yet no explicit
        reference to the restaurant is made.
      </p>

      <p>
        Only two names are listed:
        <strong>Alexander Saahil Chudasama</strong> (ledamot) and
        <strong>Sahar El Nasser</strong> (suppleant). No shareholder information
        or operational description is available beyond this bare minimum.
      </p>

      <p>
        Meanwhile, <strong>Chudasama Invest AB</strong>, held by Alexander
        Chudasama, owns under 25% of shares. However, the 2021 Articles of
        Association grant him rights to appoint and dismiss the majority of the
        board, giving him de facto operational control.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Lin Daniella Dahl</strong> and
        <strong>Henrik Kei Siebert</strong> are both registered at the same
        residential address in Trelleborg. Their shared domicile suggests a
        likely domestic relationship, although not formally stated in company
        documents.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Sahar El Nasser</strong> and
        <strong>Alexander Saahil Chudasama</strong> also appear as cohabitants
        in Malmö, based on population registry data. This co-residency
        reinforces the possibility of internal alignment in the governance of
        HSSC Event AB.
      </p>

      <p>
        Though visibly committed during those shifts, his involvement remained
        minimal outside of them. He stayed socially distant, rarely interacting
        with staff or showing signs of operational leadership.
      </p>
      <p>
        What stood out to me was the
        <strong
          >complete absence of communication between Henrik and Sahar</strong
        >. During my three weeks at Quan, I never saw them speak or exchange
        even a glance. For someone trying to understand their role, this silence
        was striking.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>On July 1st, 2024</strong>, two new legal entities were
        incorporated on the same day: <strong>Tributum AB</strong> and
        <strong>Aspiratio Holding AB</strong>. Both companies list board members
        directly connected to Quan and share the exact same address:
        <em>Mäster Johansgatan 15, Malmö</em> — the known location of Quan, HSSC
        Event AB, and Elite Hotel.
      </p>

      <p>
        By contrast, <strong>Aspiratio Holding AB</strong> is formally
        registered under <em>c/o Kehda Holding AB</em>, but still at the same
        Malmö address. Despite being legally active, Aspiratio shows
        <strong>no declared business activity</strong>,
        <strong>no F-tax registration</strong>, <strong>no VAT (Moms)</strong>,
        and <strong>no employer contributions</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Its board lists <strong>Lin Daniella Dahl</strong> as chair and
        <strong>Sahar El Nasser</strong> as deputy — forming the same tandem
        involved in Tributum, with overlapping but formally distinct roles. Both
        entities were created simultaneously and appear dormant or inactive on
        paper.
      </p>

      <p>
        No public record directly links <strong>Elite Hotels</strong> and
        <strong>HSSC Event AB</strong>. However, both companies officially
        operate from the same address:
        <strong>Mäster Johansgatan 15, Malmö</strong>. This overlap may indicate
        a tenancy or subcontracting arrangement, but the absence of published
        contracts prevents confirmation.
