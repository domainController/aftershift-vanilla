+        <p>
+          I was raised by a man who never worked for anyone else. Self-employed all his life, my father was always working‚Äînights, weekends, holidays. 
+          By age 16, I had fled that model. For decades, I rejected anything resembling business, ownership, or entrepreneurship.
+        </p>
+        <p>
+          From 30 to 35, I worked seriously‚Äîfor the first and only time in my life‚Äîin software and IT. The experience reinforced my conviction: I couldn't survive corporate life. 
+          At 38, while freelancing for a developer, I discovered the world of startups. It wasn‚Äôt a passion. It was a survival instinct. 
+          <strong>Startups felt like the only exit route</strong> from wage dependency.

+
+      <h2>Culture of Secrecy: A Slow Realization</h2>
+
+      <p>
+        My background in the restaurant sector spans about two years in
+        total‚Äîmostly split between short experiences in 2011‚Äì2012 and a 14-month
+        stretch at Da Peppe Due in Stockholm. That last position was by far the
+        longest, and came at a time when I was more mature, more curious about
+        workplace dynamics, and more attentive to what makes a business
+        function‚Äîor fail.
+      </p>
+
+      <p>
+        One of my earliest shocks came while offering to work two unpaid trial
+        hours at a small restaurant (RIPIG, possibly "Le Port Poilu"). The owner
+        looked alarmed and insisted I clock in immediately. Her tone was sharp,
+        almost canonical‚Äîmarking a deep fear of external scrutiny. That reaction
+        made visible a rule I hadn‚Äôt seen, and it revealed something else too: a
+        sector where legality is not about doing things right, but about not
+        doing them in view.
+      </p>
+
+      <p>
+        At Da Peppe Due, I witnessed a refined version of this tendency: a
+        culture of silence wrapped in ritualized vigilance. The owner rarely
+        made things explicit, but his presence shaped everyone‚Äôs behavior. It
+        wasn‚Äôt fear‚Äîit was calibration. A kind of managerial gravity that set
+        the rhythm without ever speaking.
+      </p>
+
+      <p>
+        My manager maintained an extraordinary level of control: focused,
+        composed, and perpetually measured in both tone and presence. At first,
+        I interpreted this as the hallmark of a serious entrepreneur‚Äîsomeone who
+        simply took his business seriously. But over time, I began to sense
+        something more layered: a system of guardedness, a constant filtering of
+        visibility, and an authority built not through charisma but through
+        caution.
+      </p>
+
+      <p>
+        What struck me most was the sheer generosity. I was offered a solid
+        salary from day one‚Äîhandwritten on paper‚Äîand even invited to ask for
+        more. I could eat virtually anything from the kitchen, including premium
+        cuts of organic beef, desserts, or crustaceans. The owner himself would
+        sometimes step in to replace the pizza chef and ask, ‚ÄúWant one or two
+        tonight?‚Äù It wasn‚Äôt just tolerated‚Äîit was offered.
+      </p>
+
+      <p>
+        I eventually understood that this generosity had a cost‚Äîor at least a
+        logic. It created a climate of loyalty, but also of vigilance. You could
+        enjoy the privileges, but only if you remained within invisible limits.
+        Nothing was said, yet everything was monitored. It was a world of
+        unspoken contracts: abundance, yes‚Äîbut never excess.
+      </p>
+
+      <p>
+        Dishwashing was structured in flexible pairs. If one of us called in
+        sick or didn‚Äôt feel like coming, the other would cover‚Äîand no one
+        interfered. For our manager, the only requirement was that the absence
+        remain invisible. No explanations, no approvals. Just quiet efficiency.
+      </p>
+
+      <p>
+        I could divide my workload as I pleased. With rare exceptions (like
+        cleaning the toilets), I was free to take breaks, disappear for 45
+        minutes, or even run errands‚Äî as long as the kitchen team didn‚Äôt need
+        me. I was hired to start at 3 p.m., even though nothing ever happened
+        before 5. These were paid hours. I could be scrolling Instagram, and no
+        one cared. What mattered was presence when it mattered.
+      </p>
+
+      <p>
+        This liberty wasn‚Äôt just practical‚Äîit was emotional. My manager didn‚Äôt
+        micromanage, didn‚Äôt interrogate my movements. When someone offers you
+        that kind of trust, you want to repay it. It made me feel loyal. And
+        even now, I find it hard to criticize him publicly‚Äî not because
+        everything was right, but because the generosity was real. I was never
+        questioned, even when taking long pauses or lounging in client spaces.
+      </p>
+
+      <p>
+        Over time, I began to notice patterns that suggested not everyone was
+        paid the same way‚Äîor through the same channels. Some colleagues worked
+        full schedules but seemed to report far less on paper. Others had side
+        arrangements I could only guess at. It created a sense of hierarchy not
+        based on title or skill, but on financial entanglement. The more
+        dependent they were, the worse they behaved‚Äîwith one toxic colleague
+        seemingly untouchable.
+      </p>
+
+      <p>
+        I always carried a stainless steel flask‚Äîa CamelBak-style thermos that
+        kept liquids cold and unidentifiable. For me, it was normal: I train
+        four to five days a week, run before shifts, mix powdered protein
+        drinks, and avoid alcohol entirely. I‚Äôve never bought alcohol in Sweden
+        without my partner‚Äîand I‚Äôve never touched it before a shift.
+      </p>
+
+      <p>
+        One day, the flask became a problem. Whispers started. Maybe I was
+        drinking. Maybe that‚Äôs why I was so intense. I responded by creating a
+        WhatsApp group and proposing alcohol tests with a twist: if anyone
+        failed, they owed ‚Ç¨5 or had to run 10km. I thought I was being funny. I
+        wasn‚Äôt.
+      </p>
+
+      <p>
+        My manager left the group immediately. He drank moderately, but my
+        message hit a nerve. Some colleagues apologized. Others withdrew. And I
+        realized something: in this world, what you carry becomes what people
+        project. Suspicion doesn't require evidence‚Äîit just needs a vessel no
+        one can see through.
+      </p>
+
+      <p>
+        I don‚Äôt drink beer. I never have. To me, beer is empty, the drink of
+        resignation‚Äînot of joy. If I drink at all, it‚Äôs a glass of wine with
+        something sacred: smoked sausage, ham, cheese, dark bread. I never
+        finish the glass. I save it for later, like truffles or caviar. Alcohol,
+        for me, is a ritual‚Äînever an escape.
+      </p>
+
+      <p>
+        I run. I lift. I train four or five times a week. I sleep well. I eat
+        well. And that gives you a charge‚Äî a sort of extroverted vitality that
+        others notice, and often resent. No one in the kitchen trained. I was
+        the only one moving fast, lifting crates, running errands, staying
+        sharp. And somehow, I became the suspect.
+      </p>

+        Being a dishwasher is physical. You don‚Äôt do it half-awake. You can‚Äôt.
+        It demands speed, coordination, energy. And so yes, I found it
+        obscene‚Äîbeing the one carrying, lifting, helping, and still being
+        whispered about. Being accused of drinking, simply because I was alive
+        in a place that ran on exhaustion.
+      </p>
+
+      <p>
+        The kitchen was mostly Turkish‚Äîmy boss, most of the chefs. There was a
+        Syrian dishwasher like me, and one Indonesian waitress. There was also a
+        Greek cook, Yannis, who had been there long before the current
+        ownership. His behavior was toxic‚Äîloud, degrading, sometimes cruel‚Äîand
+        yet tolerated. My boss would lower his head, literally, and wait. He
+        knew Yannis was planning to leave and open a food stand near a stadium.
+        It was easier to endure him than confront him.
+      </p>
+
+      <p>
+        Despite everything, generosity flowed. Friends of the owner ate for
+        free‚Äîformer staff, restaurant colleagues, even a few children. He never
+        advertised it. They didn‚Äôt come every day. But it was known: if you had
+        once belonged to this place, you could still be fed. It built loyalty in
+        quiet, invisible ways.
+      </p>
+
+      <p>
+        He paid me fully and on time. He once wired money within two hours after
+        a delay. He offered me more than I asked. He listened when I had
+        something to say. He once sent me a Facebook request‚Äîwhich I declined,
+        not out of spite, but because I don‚Äôt maintain casual social links. He
+        wasn‚Äôt cold, he wasn‚Äôt dominant, and he wasn‚Äôt trying to prove anything.
+        He was just kind.
+      </p>
+      <p>
+        And because of that, I can‚Äôt betray him. I‚Äôve seen things, yes. But I
+        won‚Äôt speak of them here. If I‚Äôm speaking to you now, it‚Äôs because he
+        gave me the space and dignity to survive.
+      </p>
+      <p>
+        I had a clash within the first three months‚Äîsparked not by the boss, but
+        by a server who tried to give me orders like I was beneath him. I
+        belonged to the kitchen, not the floor, and I made that clear. After my
+        earlier scandal about the flask, this incident was another fire. My boss
+        pulled me aside. He didn‚Äôt yell, but the message was clear: calm down‚Äîor
+        it ends here.
+      </p>
+
+      <p>
+        So I calmed down. I learned the order of things. I stayed fourteen
+        months. No one pushed me again. Even the manager kept a distance. People
+        knew: I spoke up, and I knew how to write. I wasn‚Äôt explosive‚Äîbut I
+        wasn‚Äôt passive. And the boss‚Äîhe stayed kind. Even then. That‚Äôs why I
+        never betrayed him.
+      </p>
+
+      <p>
+        When you work for someone generous, someone who listens, someone who
+        pays you well and lets you eat freely, you want to give something back.
+        I always filled in when needed. I did extra cleaning. I tried to make
+        him proud‚Äîdespite my temper. That balance worked. We understood each
+        other. And that‚Äôs what kept it all going.
+      </p>
