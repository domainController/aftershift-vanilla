      <h1>Legal Notice &amp; Data Policy</h1>

      <h2>1. Site Publisher</h2>
      <p>
        Site owner: Patrice Kenmoé (individual)<br />
        Address: Hyllie Boulevard 34, 215 32 Malmö, Sweden<br />
        Email: <a href="mailto:patrice@aftershift.se">patrice@aftershift.se</a>
      </p>

      <h2>2. Hosting</h2>
      <p>
        Hosted by GitHub, Inc.<br />
        88 Colin P. Kelly Jr Street, San Francisco, CA 94107, USA
      </p>

      <h2>3. Purpose of the Blog</h2>
      <p>
        AfterShift is a personal blog documenting legal reflections and lived
        experience in the context of labor, legal inertia, and social structure.
        It is neither a company nor a journalistic entity. Its tone is personal,
        reflective, and evolving.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Legal Status</h2>
      <p>
        The blog is managed by an individual based in Sweden and follows Swedish
        legal jurisdiction. Any disputes shall be handled by the courts of
        Malmö.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Editorial Responsibility</h2>
      <p>
        The blog is authored by Patrice Kenmoé. All content is self-published.
        Names and details may be anonymized to ensure privacy and legal safety.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Disclaimer</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          This blog represents personal experience and analysis. It is not
          intended to target individuals or damage reputations. The aim is to
          document systemic issues and provide structured, respectful
          commentary. Content is subject to frequent updates as the platform
          evolves.
        </li>

        <li>
          In narrative sections of the blog, certain personal names may be
          altered to protect the identity of individuals. These changes are made
          in good faith and aim to balance narrative clarity with respect for
          privacy. Any resemblance to real persons, living or dead, outside of
          documented facts, is coincidental.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>7. Commenting &amp; Feedback</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          The AfterShift blog includes a comment system (currently planned via
          Giscus, a lightweight tool built on GitHub Discussions).
        </li>
        <li>
          Giscus requires a GitHub account to participate in discussions. This
          choice was made for fast deployment and is not intended to restrict
          participation.
        </li>
        <li>
          Users who cannot or do not wish to use GitHub may contact us via email
          or participate through other platforms (e.g., OB1 Circles).
        </li>
        <li>
          As the platform evolves, comments may migrate to alternative tools
          (e.g., Commento or embedded forms), provided privacy and legal
          compliance are maintained.
        </li>
        <li>
          All significant changes will be clearly communicated via updated terms
          or page footers.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>8. Intellectual Property</h2>
      <p>
        All texts, visuals, and documents are original creations and property of
        Patrice Kenmoé unless otherwise stated. No reproduction is permitted
        without written consent.
      </p>

      <h2>9. Privacy &amp; Data</h2>
      <p>
        No personal data is collected without consent. Matomo Analytics may be
        used in full compliance with GDPR regulations. No cookies or identifiers
        are used to track individuals.
      </p>

      <h2>10. Evolution &amp; Versioning</h2>
      <p>
        This blog is updated daily and may evolve significantly over time. Legal
        notices and key policy documents are versioned and may change regularly.
        Changes will be documented and dated.
      </p>

      <h2>11. Cross-site Relationship</h2>
      <p>
        AfterShift is independent but connected to OB1.se (a separate community
        platform). Both are maintained by the same author but serve different
        purposes. Legal responsibilities are clearly separated.
      </p>

      <h2>12. PDF Fingerprinting & Traceability</h2>
      <p>
        Each access-restricted document is uniquely fingerprinted prior to
        delivery. This process does not affect readability or file structure but
        embeds a non-visible identifier to help trace unauthorized
        redistribution.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fingerprinting serves both to discourage leaks and to identify the
        origin of any unauthorized reproduction, without storing personal
        information in the file.
      </p>

      <h2>13. Access Control and Strategic Extract Requests</h2>

<p>
  Access to certain high-sensitivity materials—such as those contained within the <strong>Strategic Extract</strong>—is restricted and subject to manual review.
  Requests may be denied at the author's discretion.
</p>

<p>
  In order to protect both the integrity of the archive and the identity of contributors, any request to access these documents requires identifiable contact details.
</p>

<p>
  These details (such as <strong>name, email address, professional affiliation</strong>, or equivalent) are logged for the sole purpose of traceability and will <u>never</u> be shared, sold, or publicly disclosed. This approach is designed to <span class="highlight">prevent abuse, reduce data diffusion, and preserve the site’s independence</span>.
</p>

<p>
  If a request is declined, a brief notification may be sent to the requester explaining the reason.
</p>

<p>
  Your submission constitutes acceptance of this protocol. The database of access requests is stored securely and used exclusively to assess access legitimacy.
