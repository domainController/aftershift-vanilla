      <h1>Legal Notice &amp; Data Policy</h1>

      <h2>1. Site Publisher</h2>
      <p>
        Site owner: Patrice Kenmoé (individual)<br />
        Address: Hyllie Boulevard 34, 215 32 Malmö, Sweden<br />
        Email: <a href="mailto:patrice@aftershift.se">patrice@aftershift.se</a>
      </p>

      <h2>2. Hosting</h2>
      <p>
        Hosted by GitHub, Inc.<br />
        88 Colin P. Kelly Jr Street, San Francisco, CA 94107, USA
      </p>

      <h2>3. Purpose of the Blog</h2>
      <p>
        AfterShift is a personal blog documenting legal reflections and lived
        experience in the context of labor, legal inertia, and social structure.
        It is neither a company nor a journalistic entity. Its tone is personal,
        reflective, and evolving.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Legal Status</h2>
      <p>
        The blog is managed by an individual based in Sweden and follows Swedish
        legal jurisdiction. Any disputes shall be handled by the courts of
        Malmö.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Editorial Responsibility</h2>
      <p>
        The blog is authored by Patrice Kenmoé. All content is self-published.
        Names and details may be anonymized to ensure privacy and legal safety.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Disclaimer</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          This blog represents personal experience and analysis. It is not
          intended to target individuals or damage reputations. The aim is to
          document systemic issues and provide structured, respectful
          commentary. Content is subject to frequent updates as the platform
          evolves.
        </li>

        <li>
          In narrative sections of the blog, certain personal names may be
          altered to protect the identity of individuals. These changes are made
          in good faith and aim to balance narrative clarity with respect for
          privacy. Any resemblance to real persons, living or dead, outside of
          documented facts, is coincidental.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>7. Commenting &amp; Feedback</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          The AfterShift blog includes a comment system (currently planned via
          Giscus, a lightweight tool built on GitHub Discussions).
        </li>
        <li>
          Giscus requires a GitHub account to participate in discussions. This
          choice was made for fast deployment and is not intended to restrict
          participation.
        </li>
        <li>
          Users who cannot or do not wish to use GitHub may contact us via email
          or participate through other platforms (e.g., OB1 Circles).
        </li>
        <li>
          As the platform evolves, comments may migrate to alternative tools
          (e.g., Commento or embedded forms), provided privacy and legal
          compliance are maintained.
        </li>
        <li>
          All significant changes will be clearly communicated via updated terms
          or page footers.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>8. Intellectual Property</h2>
      <p>
        All texts, visuals, and documents are original creations and property of
        Patrice Kenmoé unless otherwise stated. No reproduction is permitted
        without written consent.
      </p>

      <h2>9. Privacy &amp; Data</h2>
      <p>
        No personal data is collected without consent. Matomo Analytics may be
        used in full compliance with GDPR regulations. No cookies or identifiers
        are used to track individuals.
      </p>

      <h2>10. Evolution &amp; Versioning</h2>
      <p>
        This blog is updated daily and may evolve significantly over time. Legal
        notices and key policy documents are versioned and may change regularly.
        Changes will be documented and dated.
      </p>

      <h2>11. Cross-site Relationship</h2>
      <p>
        AfterShift is independent but connected to OB1.se (a separate community
        platform). Both are maintained by the same author but serve different
        purposes. Legal responsibilities are clearly separated.
      </p>

      <h2>12. PDF Fingerprinting & Traceability</h2>
      <p>
        Each access-restricted document is uniquely fingerprinted prior to
        delivery. This process does not affect readability or file structure but
        embeds a non-visible identifier to help trace unauthorized
        redistribution.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fingerprinting serves both to discourage leaks and to identify the
        origin of any unauthorized reproduction, without storing personal
        information in the file.
      </p>

      <h2>13. Access Control and Strategic Extract Requests</h2>

      <p>
        Access to certain high-sensitivity materials—such as those contained
        within the <strong>Strategic Extract</strong>—is restricted and subject
        to manual review. Requests may be denied at the author's discretion.
      </p>

      <p>
        In order to protect both the integrity of the archive and the identity
        of contributors, any request to access these documents requires
        identifiable contact details.
      </p>

      <p>
        These details (such as
        <strong>name, email address, professional affiliation</strong>, or
        equivalent) are logged for the sole purpose of traceability and will
        <u>never</u> be shared, sold, or publicly disclosed. This approach is
        designed to
        <span class="highlight"
          >prevent abuse, reduce data diffusion, and preserve the site’s
          independence</span
        >.
      </p>

      <p>
        If a request is declined, a brief notification may be sent to the
        requester explaining the reason.
      </p>

      <p>
        Your submission constitutes acceptance of this protocol. The database of
        access requests is stored securely and used exclusively to assess access
        legitimacy.

        <h1>Defense FAQ</h1>

        <h2>1. What is the legal nature of this site?</h2>
        <p>
          This site is a civic archive authored by an individual residing in
          Sweden. It documents first-hand labor experiences, backed by personal
          and official records. It is non-commercial, non-affiliated, and
          protected under Swedish and European legal frameworks (freedom of
          expression, right to document, public interest).
        </p>

        <h2>2. Are personal names or companies exposed?</h2>

        Names are mentioned only when they are part of:
        <ul>
          <li>Public registries (e.g., Bolagsverket, Skatteverket)</li>
          <li>
            Legally documented employer roles or decision-making positions
          </li>
          <li>
            Situations with direct operational or legal relevance to the
            grievance
          </li>
        </ul>
        Where appropriate, names may be anonymized or partially redacted.

        <h2>3. Why is this public and not private?</h2>
        <p>
          Legal communication channels have been exhausted or met with silence,
          threats, or procedural evasion. Not all damage is litigable. Public
          documentation allows patterns to emerge, informs others in similar
          situations, and serves as a civil ledger of misconduct or procedural
          failure.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Is this defamatory?</h2>

        No. Every element is:
        <ul>
          <li>Backed by documents, screenshots, or official filings</li>
          <li>
            Presented in a structured, cautious, and legally filtered tone
          </li>
          <li>Free from insult or distortion</li>
        </ul>
        If an error is found, it may be corrected upon request.

        <h2>5. What if you are mentioned?</h2>

        You may:
        <ul>
          <li>Submit a factual correction or clarification</li>
          <li>Provide a verifiable rebuttal or timeline</li>
          <li>Request anonymization if proportionate and justified</li>
        </ul>
        Contact:
        <a href="mailto:patrice@aftershift.se">patrice@aftershift.se</a> or use
        the <a href="/contact.html">contact form</a>.

        <h2>6. Can this be cited or reused?</h2>

        Yes. Provided that:
        <ul>
          <li>AfterShift.se is mentioned as the source</li>
          <li>No modification is made to the excerpts</li>
          <li>
            The context of citation respects proportionality and good faith
          </li>
        </ul>
        Journalists, academics, and legal professionals are welcome to contact
        the author for clarification.

        <h2>7. Is this politically or union-affiliated?</h2>
        <p>
          No. The initiative is personal and independent. Any external reuse by
          union or political actors is not coordinated or solicited.
        </p>

        <h2>8. Why are some materials access-restricted?</h2>
        <p>
          Some financial breakdowns, offshore documentation, or legal records
          are not published openly to preserve negotiation leverage, ensure
          editorial safety, or avoid premature exposure of sensitive data. These
          are accessible on a case-by-case basis through the
          <a href="/confidential.html">Confidential Insight Access</a> section,
          where requesters must identify themselves and explain their interest.
        </p>

        <h2>9. What happens if access is denied?</h2>
        <p>
          Requests that do not meet minimal verification criteria will receive a
          formal rejection notice. This includes vague, unverifiable, or
          pseudonymous identities.
        </p>
        <p>
          The author reserves the right to deny access at their discretion,
          based on editorial and security considerations. Applicants are not
          added to any database, and rejected identities are not retained.

        <h1>Response Rights & Legal Integrity</h1>

        <h2>🛡️ Purpose</h2>
        <p>
          This page outlines the public policy for legal interactions, factual
          rebuttals, correction requests, and the documentation of any attempts
          to suppress or informally negotiate away public interest material.
        </p>

        <h2>📣 Right of Reply</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Submit a verifiable factual correction</li>
          <li>Provide context or supporting documents</li>
          <li>Request anonymization (if justified and proportionate)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Requests will be reviewed in good faith. Valid additions or
          clarifications will be acknowledged and publicly reflected in
          footnotes or appendices.
        </p>

        <h2>☎️ Recording Policy for Calls & Outreach</h2>
        <p>
          Due to past experiences of coercion and veiled threats, all phone
          calls and voice messages <strong>may be recorded</strong> for
          transparency, archiving, and legal protection.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            This includes direct calls, intermediaries, and informal emissaries.
          </li>
          <li>
            Any interaction deemed intimidatory, manipulative, or designed to
            bypass formal channels
            <strong>may be documented and referenced</strong> in future updates.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>📨 Handling Legal Letters or Notices</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Legal communication may be summarized, quoted, or published in full.
          </li>
          <li>
            Identities may be anonymized unless public or legally relevant.
          </li>
          <li>
            Communications relying on intimidation may be publicly challenged.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>🔍 Transparency Clause</h2>
        <p>This project maintains the right to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Publicly respond to formal or informal pressure</li>
          <li>Trace outreach patterns and motives</li>

        <h2>📄 April 2025 — Letter from Head Chef Henrik Ling</h2>

        <p>
          <strong>Sender:</strong> Henrik Kling, Head Chef at Quan / HSSC Event
          AB<br />
          <strong>Recipient:</strong> AfterShift Editor (K.P.)<br />
          <strong>Date:</strong> April 17, 2025<br />
          <strong>Method:</strong> Attached PDF, sent via personal email, no
          subject line
        </p>

        <p>
          This letter was sent in response to an initial legal notice issued by
          the editor of this site in early April 2025. The notice related to
          delayed employer certificates, potential unlawful dismissal, and
          informal coercion following a trial contract termination.
        </p>

        <p>
          Instead of receiving a reply from legal counsel or management, the
          company delegated the response to <strong>Henrik Kling</strong>, the
          <em>head chef and senior figure in the kitchen brigade</em>. The
          letter arrived as a simple PDF attachment, with no explanatory message
          or subject line. This form and channel of response were perceived as
          <strong>dismissive and non-serious</strong>, which prompted a second
          formal notice from the claimant — never opened by the company.
        </p>

        <blockquote
          style="
            border-left: 4px solid #ccc;
            padding-left: 1em;
            font-style: italic;
            color: #555;
          "
        >
          “It is reasonable to interpret this response not as an official legal
          stance, but rather as a delegated placeholder — written quickly
          between two shifts, perhaps with the assistance of a generative
          language model.”<br />
          – Editorial Note
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          The letter offers no legal rebuttal, acknowledges no facts, and closes
          with a vague offer of two weeks’ compensation — unsigned and without
          legal formatting.
