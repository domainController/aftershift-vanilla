+        After three years in Ireland and a strategic return through

+        The move was deliberate. My goal was to stabilize my legal and financial

+        <strong>In 2012</strong>, I entered what I would later call my
+        <strong>35–45 sequence</strong>: a phase of <strong>rejection</strong> —
+        first of the <strong>corporate world</strong>, then the
+        <strong>welfare state</strong>. My first move was

+        I didn’t want guidance. I wanted to
+        <strong>build my own compass</strong>. I believed there had to be a
+        way—through reading, trial, and structure—to design a protocol for life.

+        I never liked the word “startup.” What fascinated me was the logic of
+        <strong>venture creation</strong>: building something radically new,
+        with full creative freedom, in a space of uncertainty and high
+        asymmetry. I wanted <strong>leverage without permission</strong>—a way
+        to test ideas, own the upside, and stay free. It wasn’t just about
+        innovation. It was about <u>the possibility of wealth through chaos</u>.
+      </p>
+
+      <h2><mark style="background-color: #e0e0e0">Power Structures</mark></h2>
+
+      <p>
+        Before any “growth,” I had already begun reading extensively on
+        <u>geopolitics</u>, <u>economic systems</u>, and
+        <u>power structures</u> during my final years in France I needed to
+        <strong>understand the architecture of constraint</strong>. As early as
+        <strong>age 33</strong>, I had already started to decode the
+        <strong>political, economic and social architecture</strong> around me —
+        the first axis of thought I would later define as
+        <strong>System Decryption</strong>.. I spent years decoding power
+        systems—politics, media, finance, welfare—until I saw how consent was
+        manufactured. It wasn’t paranoia. It was self-defense.

+        This period, from <strong>35 to 40</strong>, became an unstructured

+        coherent — but it was transformative. By 40, I had not arrived anywhere.
+        But I was no longer lost.
