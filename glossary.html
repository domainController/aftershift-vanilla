          A <strong>disclaimer</strong> is a legal statement that limits or

        <summary><strong>Holding Company</strong></summary>
        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
          A <strong>Holding Company</strong> is an entity created to own shares
          in one or more other companies, usually without direct commercial
          operations of its own. Its purpose is to control, consolidate, or
          protect underlying business assets.
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
          In large corporate groups, a holding might coordinate finance, legal
          strategy, and investment flows across subsidiaries.
          <u>In smaller setups or offshore structures</u>, however, holdings may
          serve more symbolic or strategic purposes — such as
          <span style="background-color: #e5e7eb"
            >isolating liabilities, fragmenting control, or hiding the true
            beneficial owner</span
          >.
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
          The term “holding” does not guarantee operational depth.
          <strong>In your case, MedFood Holdings Ltd</strong> is registered in
          Cyprus, has no known employees or infrastructure, and serves
          exclusively as the legal owner of IzakayaKoi AB post-2004. This is a
          <u>classic example of a passive holding vehicle</u> — potentially
          designed for tax or opacity purposes.
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
          A holding may appear legitimate in public records, yet be disconnected
          from the daily operations, which remain handled by nominees or
          external managers. That’s why
          <span style="background-color: #e5e7eb"
            >the title “holding” must always be cross-examined</span
          >
          with actual business substance.
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
          In forensic work, holdings act as anchors: they centralize formal
          control but may not reflect the real ecosystem of people, payments,
          and power.
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
          <strong>In corporate genealogy, holdings are structural pivots</strong
          >: they signal transitions, ownership shifts, or hidden
          consolidations. Identifying their connections helps reconstruct
          ownership trees and expose coordination across legal entities.

        <summary><strong>Legal Notice</strong></summary>
        <p>
          A <strong>legal notice</strong> (or <em>mentions légales</em> in
          French) refers to the mandatory publication of identifying details
          about the entity behind a website, such as the publisher, address, VAT
          number, or legal operator.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Sweden, this is enforced under the
          <strong>E-commerce Act (2002:562)</strong> and ensures transparency,
          consumer protection, and traceability.
        </p>
        <p>
          Non-compliance can hinder legal recourse in disputes or complaints.

        <summary><strong>Corporate Genealogy</strong></summary>
        <p>
          <strong>Corporate genealogy</strong> is the structured mapping of a
          company's legal identity over time: mergers, name changes,
          acquisitions, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is widely used in <em>finance</em>, <em>M&A</em>,
          <em>regulatory compliance</em>, and
          <em>journalistic investigations</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Example: tracing ownership chains to assess liability or business
          continuity.

        <summary><strong>Forensic History</strong></summary>
        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
          <strong>Forensic History</strong> is the structured reconstruction of
          past events, decisions, and connections in order to understand how a
          situation unfolded — especially in the context of conflict, risk, or
          hidden agendas.
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
          Unlike classic historical narrative, forensic history focuses on
          <strong
            >intentional omissions, grey zones, and invisible
            relationships</strong
          >. It aims to reassemble what was disaggregated — legally,
          structurally, or rhetorically.
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
          It is particularly useful when
          <span style="background-color: #e5e7eb"
            >official documents appear clean</span
          >
          but a deeper logic of obfuscation or control is suspected. It
          mobilizes documents, registries, press archives, leaks, and timeline
          inconsistencies to create a coherent map.
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
          In your use case, forensic history helps determine
          <u>when real ownership diverged from legal representation</u>, and
          whether events (e.g. liquidation, resignations, trust formations) are
          symptoms of deeper coordination.
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
          Forensic history is used by investigative journalists, judicial
          commissions, corporate analysts, and researchers dealing with opaque
          ecosystems. It often reveals
          <strong>the intentional engineering of forgetting</strong>.
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
          It does not prove fraud directly — but it builds a high-resolution
          narrative capable of exposing contradictions that justify deeper
          scrutiny.

      </details>

      <details>
        <summary><strong>Four Corners Rule</strong></summary>
        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
          The <strong>Four Corners Rule</strong> is a legal principle stating
          that a document must be interpreted solely based on what is written
          “within its four corners” — meaning the four sides of the paper. No
          external evidence may be introduced to modify or explain the text
          unless the document is ambiguous.
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
          Originating in <strong>Anglo-American contract law</strong>, the
          doctrine is used in courts to determine the intent of a contract or
          agreement, by restricting analysis to its internal content.
          <u
            >Everything needed for interpretation must be found in the document
            itself</u
          >.
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
          In forensic work, this principle becomes relevant when documents (like
          shareholder agreements, minutes, audits) are drafted to appear
          self-contained and unambiguous — even when their real function may be
          to disguise a transfer, an omission, or a hidden beneficiary.
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
          <span style="background-color: #e5e7eb"
            >The Four Corners Rule is useful to expose what is intentionally
            omitted</span
          >. When a document is silent on a topic that would logically be
          mentioned, the absence itself can become a clue — especially when
          compared across versions or years.
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
          In your case, the principle helps evaluate whether documents (e.g.
          annual reports, resolutions, agreements) are “complete” or were
          drafted to
          <strong
            >appear formally correct while omitting material relationships or
            changes of control</strong
          >.
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
          It is not a forensic tool in itself — but it sets the ground for
          spotting legal engineering or documentary stagecraft, especially when
          paired with timeline analysis and external evidence.
        </p>

        <summary><strong>Principle of the 4 Coherences</strong></summary>
        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
          This method tests the plausibility of a structural or operational link
          between two entities by evaluating consistency across four forensic
          axes:
        </p>
        <ul style="line-height: 1.4">
          <li>
            <strong>Temporal Coherence</strong>: Do major events (e.g. share
            transfers, liquidations, restructurings) occur in synchrony or
            sequence?
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Geographic Coherence</strong>: Do both companies operate
            from the same physical or legal address? Any overlap in site usage
            or postal registrations?
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Financial Coherence</strong>: Are there interlinked cash
            flows (e.g. rent, loans, management fees)? Do declared profits and
            losses evolve in tandem or offset each other?
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Decision-Making Coherence</strong>: Do the same individuals
            appear in both boards, signatures, or meeting minutes?
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
          A strong match across all four dimensions can justify a hypothesis of
          concealed continuity, de facto control, or orchestrated restructuring
          — even without a formal merger or holding structure.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary><strong>Theory A – Risk-Sharing Structure</strong></summary>
        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
          This hypothesis assumes that multiple companies are maintained in
          parallel in order to distribute tax exposure or legal liability. One
          company (e.g. IzakayaKoi) takes on aggressive practices (undeclared
          cash, off-book transactions), while another (e.g. Steakhouse AB)
          remains “clean” and operational.
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
          The goal is to let one entity absorb the risk — tax audits, sanctions,
          or permanent revocation — while keeping another entity
          <strong
            >shielded from scrutiny and ready to continue operations</strong
          >.
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
          This structure is most effective when
          <span style="background-color: #e5e7eb"
            >the clean company is superficially unconnected</span
          >
          but shares key characteristics: location, people, suppliers, and cash
          patterns.
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
          It often appears as a legal relay, where one entity “falls” while
          another quietly takes over without interruption.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary><strong>Theory B – Asset Stripping Strategy</strong></summary>
        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
          This theory posits that one company is progressively emptied of its
          valuable assets (equipment, personnel, clientele, brand, cash) in
          favor of another — typically a newer, safer, or less exposed entity.
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
          The original entity (e.g. IzakayaKoi AB) appears to decline in
          performance, while the receiving entity (e.g. Steakhouse AB) suddenly
          improves, often without a formal transfer or acquisition.
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
          Red flags include: <strong>underpriced asset sales</strong>,
          <span style="background-color: #e5e7eb"
            >overlapping employees or leases</span
          >, and strategic underreporting of profits in the stripped entity.
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
          The intent is to allow one company to "die" formally while another
          captures the value — often in anticipation of bankruptcy, audit, or
          tax exposure.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary><strong>Board Member</strong></summary>
        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
          A <strong>Board Member</strong> is a legally registered director
          responsible for overseeing and formally representing the company’s
          interests. In most jurisdictions, this position grants voting power on
          key governance issues such as financial reporting, strategic
          decisions, and executive appointments.
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
          Board Members are usually appointed by shareholders. In larger
          companies, they are selected for their experience or expertise and may
          sit as part of a multi-member board with clear role distributions
          (Chairperson, Treasurer, etc.).
          <strong
            >In smaller companies, the board may consist of a single
            individual</strong
          >
          — often the founder or a family member — making the board structure a
          legal formality rather than a functioning body.
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
          <strong>The presence of only one board member</strong> (especially
          when coupled with a <em>Deputy Board Member</em> but no wider
          governance team) often reflects a tightly held company,
          <strong>possibly a shell entity</strong>, or a low-activity business.
          In forensic terms, this may suggest risk exposure due to limited
          oversight or consolidated control.
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
          Board members have <strong>personal legal liability</strong> in cases
          of fraudulent reporting, tax evasion, or corporate negligence. Their
          names are typically listed in national company registries and can be
          tracked across multiple entities to detect patterns of control,
          influence, or recurring irregularities.
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
          The board structure serves
          <strong>both functional and symbolic</strong> purposes. In robust
          firms, it supports governance and transparency. In minimal structures,
          it may serve only to meet registration requirements while
          <strong>shielding decision-makers behind formal titles</strong>.
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
          In corporate genealogy, board members are essential markers for
          tracing continuity and control across legal entities, especially when
          company names or registration numbers change but human operators
          remain the same.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary><strong>Deputy Board Member</strong></summary>
        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
          A Deputy Board Member (or
          <em>Alternate Director</em>) is a legally designated substitute who
          takes over a Board Member’s duties
          <strong
            >in case of death, resignation, illness, or formal absence</strong
          >. Outside of such events, this role is passive and has no legal
          authority or voting power.
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
          <strong>In smaller companies or single-director firms</strong>, this
          role is often added <u>for compliance reasons</u>.
          <span style="background-color: #e5e7eb"
            >Swedish law, for example, requires the nomination of a deputy if
            the board has only one formal member</span
          >. The deputy ensures administrative continuity without implying any
          real involvement.
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
          <strong>This position is typically symbolic</strong> and rarely
          activated in practice. In many cases, deputy members are friends,
          family members, or legal acquaintances of the main director — not
          selected for oversight capacity but simply to satisfy registry
          conditions.
        </p>

        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
          An <strong>Auditor</strong> (or statutory auditor) is an
          <u>external party legally appointed</u> to review, verify, and sign
          off on a company’s financial statements. Their mission is to certify
          that the accounts give a fair view of the company's financial position
          and comply with applicable laws.
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
          <strong>In larger corporations</strong>, this role is held by licensed
          audit firms (e.g., KPMG, PwC) and plays a crucial part in investor
          confidence and regulatory compliance.
          <u>In small private companies</u>, the auditor is often an independent
          accountant — or sometimes a close associate — with a role that is
          <span style="background-color: #e5e7eb"
            >more formal than substantial</span

            ><strong>Auditors must be independent</strong></span
          >, both in function and appearance. They are legally barred from
          management roles or shareholding. However, in practice —
          <u>especially in small firms</u> — the auditor may be a friend, former
          consultant, or recurring figure validating multiple companies across a
          network.
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
          <strong>The identity of the auditor</strong> is often a critical
          forensic clue: do they appear in other linked firms? Are they involved
          in known tax audits? <u>A passive or unqualified auditor</u> may
          indicate systemic opacity or administrative negligence.

          In forensic history and corporate genealogy, the auditor may not hold
          power, but

          A <strong>Deputy Auditor</strong> (or <em>alternate auditor</em>) is a

          fulfill their role. <u>Outside of such circumstances</u>, the deputy
          has no official function, no signature power, and no influence on the
          company's financial reporting.

          exists to preserve continuity in the audit process, but
          <u>in practice, is rarely involved</u> unless triggered by an
          unforeseen event.
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
          <strong>In small or private companies</strong>, deputy auditors are
          often individuals with no active link to the business: acquaintances,
          family members, or professionals added to satisfy registration forms.
          <span style="background-color: #e5e7eb"
            >Their appointment does not indicate active oversight</span

          — especially when their names never appear elsewhere in the corporate

          An <strong>Offshore Country</strong> refers to a jurisdiction where
          companies can be registered with minimal regulatory requirements, low

        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
          <u>Examples include Cyprus, Panama, and Costa Rica</u>. Companies

        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
          These legal structures often allow nominee directors or legal

        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
          A <strong>Holding Company</strong> is a legal entity created to own
          shares in one or more other companies. It typically does not produce
          goods or services itself but exists to manage equity, coordinate
          ownership, or consolidate financial control.
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
          <u>In large corporate groups</u>, holding companies may centralize
          strategy, tax optimization, or risk management across subsidiaries.
          However,
          <span style="background-color: #e5e7eb"
            >in smaller or offshore structures</span

          <strong
            >The word “holding” does not guarantee operational depth</strong

        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
          Holding companies are often used to group together several businesses
          under a common ownership umbrella, but they can also appear in
          multi-layered ownership networks where the real actors remain behind
          nominees or corporate veils.
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
          In forensic analysis, a holding company may act as an anchor — it
          holds the legal link to assets, but not necessarily the power to
          operate or decide. Identifying who controls the holding itself is
          often more important than the holding’s official status.
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
          In corporate genealogy,
          <strong>holdings mark key transitions</strong>: acquisitions,

          <strong>Forensic Accounting</strong> refers to the specialized

        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
          Practitioners combine accounting expertise with investigative

        <p style="line-height: 1.4">
          In the context of small businesses or shell companies, forensic
          accounting is used to

          The method is particularly useful when a company presents a legal
