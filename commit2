+            I met Sarah online shortly before relocating to Stockholm. Within
+            two weeks, we moved in together—partly due to a strong connection,
+            but mostly driven by mutual economic need. She had two children and
+            had just lost her flatmate. I needed stable housing in Stockholm. It
+            felt mutually logical.

+            From my first full paycheck, I contributed up to
+            <strong>16,000 SEK/month</strong> toward rent, food, car fuel,
+            insurance, and more. This amount also included an informal
+            reimbursement for the initial months she had supported me.

+          <p>
+            We had a verbal agreement: either we would build a family, or we
+            would build a company. This was my condition for long-term

+            From the outset, I insisted on structured communication. I created
+            the concept of <em>Pilotalks</em>: one hour of discussion every
+            evening, and weekend walks to reflect and recalibrate. These efforts
+            were short-lived. Over time, communication degraded. My repeated
+            attempts to create a weekly agenda or set shared goals were avoided.

+            I tried to bridge our differences by aligning on values, building a

+            vision. I proposed working sessions to define purpose, mission, and
+            market niche. Despite pockets of motivation, the consistent effort

+            recurring disrespect—from both her and her children. Her
+            ex-partner’s presence added stress, often interrupting our daily

+          <p>
+            I felt reduced to a provider. The trust I offered was used for
