      <h1>Weak Signals</h1>

      <p>
        On <strong>November 16</strong>, I sent a spontaneous application to
        <strong>Quan</strong>. I was aware the restaurant was attached to a
        hotel, but only during my trial shift did I fully realize the extent of
        its integration within a <strong>4-star hotel</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Many of my early questions—about dishware, trolleys, or food
        storage—were answered with “it’s for the hotel.” I deduced that the
        entire food and conference service, including breakfast, was run by the
        same company, but no clear onboarding ever explained these overlaps. The
        structure remained opaque.
      </p>
      <p>

          >
        </strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        Her familiarity felt disproportionate coming from someone I’d never met.
        I responded politely but awkwardly, unsure who she was. When she and
        Henrik entered the meeting room together, she naturally led the
        conversation. That’s when I assumed she was
        <strong>in charge of the restaurant</strong>—someone with practical
        authority beyond her official title.
      </p>
      <div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 20px">
        <img
          src="./assets/img/tear.jpg"
          alt=""
          style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 8px"
        />
      </div>
      <p>
        No one introduced her or confirmed her title. Later, colleagues casually
        referred to her as <em>“the boss.”</em> I had no reason to doubt it. I
        only discovered much later she was
        <strong>formally listed as Deputy Board Member</strong>—a position that
        carries no formal management authority in Sweden.
      </p>

      <p>
        That gap between perceived authority and official status didn’t strike
        me immediately, but it shaped a subtle confusion. I adapted to her
        leadership as if she were the founder or legal manager. At no point was
        I told otherwise.
      </p>

      <p>
        That ambiguity had immediate consequences: moments earlier, I had
        greeted several team members, including a
        <strong>floor manager</strong> I’d bonded with during my shift. He
        ignored my handshake. In retrospect, I interpreted this as a reaction to
        my rushed greeting to her—possibly seen as a
        <strong>lack of deference to the executive lead</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The session itself was warm.
        <strong>Henrik showed visible enthusiasm</strong>, while Sahar remained
        measured but positive. Both seemed relieved to have found someone
        <em>“reliable”</em>. I, too, felt I had landed in the right place,
        though I sensed a slight mismatch between Sahar’s informal posture and
        the authority she embodied.
      </p>
      <p>
        The tone was enthusiastic. They expressed visible relief at finding
        someone “reliable.” They emphasized three principles:
        <strong>punctuality</strong>, <strong>exclusive availability</strong>,
        and <strong>attention to detail</strong>—framed as missing virtues in
        their previous hires.
      </p>

      <p>
        I was offered an hourly rate of <strong>160 SEK/h</strong> on the spot,
        based on my CV and the trial performance. I disclosed an existing
        weekend job, which Sahar acknowledged without hesitation, even framing
        it as a sign of integrity.
      </p>

      <p>
        During that meeting,
        <strong>Sahar mentioned a digital contract</strong> would be sent. I
        expected it within days, but no document ever arrived. No login
        credentials, no confirmation, no follow-up. The promise remained
        unfulfilled despite clear mutual agreement.
      </p>

      <p>
        I also raised a condition: receiving a share of <strong>tips</strong>.
        They said the matter would be discussed with the floor and bar managers.
        A few days later, both confirmed their approval individually. No
        contract followed, but Sahar briefly mentioned one would—possibly via
        their internal system. That mention was never repeated.
      </p>
      <p>
        Throughout this period,
        <strong>my only point of contact was Henrik</strong>. His number was the
        only one I received. Any attempt to address questions or follow up—about
        schedules, duties, or documents—was redirected:
        <em>“I'll ask Sahar.”</em> Eventually,
        <strong>I stopped asking</strong>. He often seemed embarrassed or
        reluctant.
      </p>

      <p>
        When he was absent, I was told to ask the <strong>sous-chefs</strong>.
        That proved even more difficult. Their responses felt dismissive, and I
        quickly sensed that <strong>pushing further was unwelcome</strong>. I
        began submitting written questions to the restaurant’s general email.
        These were not challenged, but I knew
        <strong>they fell outside accepted channels</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The meeting lasted approximately <strong>30 minutes</strong>, between
        <strong>13:53 and 14:28</strong>, as confirmed in my Google Timeline.
        Though informal in tone, it set the
        <strong>essential terms of work</strong> and gave rise to what I
        interpreted as the <strong>start of formal employment</strong>.
