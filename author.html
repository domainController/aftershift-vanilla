    <h1>Bio</h1><p class="page-timestamp">Updated: Saturday, 26 April 2025 at 06:29:56</p>

    <p>
      I'm <strong>Patrice Kenmoé</strong>, writer, observer, and creator of <em>AfterShift</em>. Based in Malmö, Sweden, I document the realities of labor and legal neglect — particularly within the restaurant and hospitality sectors.
    </p>

    <p>
      My investigations center on the legal grey zones that precarious workers regularly confront: missing contracts, withheld wages, or administrative silence. Through procedural exploration and factual accounts, I aim to expose the structures that allow employer misconduct to persist.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>AfterShift</em> is both a personal archive and a tactical publishing project — a space where experience meets legal strategy, and silence meets documentation.
    </p>

    <p>
      The underlying story began in the winter of 2024, while I was employed as a dishwasher at <strong>Quan</strong>, a high-end restaurant in Malmö. Despite a high workload and positive feedback, no written contract was ever issued. Wages were delayed, and the classification of my departure later resulted in a suspension of benefits.
